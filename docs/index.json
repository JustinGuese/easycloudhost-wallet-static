[{"categories":["EasyKube"],"contents":"Kubernetes can be complex, but once you get to know the basics, it is a wonderful tool allowing you to get up and running quickly. Once you have deployed your first services, there are common pitfalls in terms of security that you might miss. This article touches on the Top 7 misconceptions.\nGrab your free PDF Download of this article, including a free Checklist!!\n\r1. Kubernetes Namespaces isolate containers Thinking that namespaces isolate containers is a common misconception. They are only showing up in that specific namespace, but are not isolated from each other. Let us say you are running a postgresql deployment in the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; namespace as service name \u0026ldquo;psql-deployment\u0026rdquo;. If you start up another container, you are able to connect to it connecting to \u0026ldquo;psql-deployment:5432\u0026rdquo;. Now, if you move your second deployment to another namespace, you will not be able to connect anymore.\nNow it might be easy to think that namespaces isolate network resources, but the truth is only the routing changed, and the pod can still communicate with the psql-deployment. We could try this out by using the internal DNS routing called \u0026ldquo;psql-deployment.default.svc.cluster.local\u0026rdquo;. As you can see the structure is [SERVICE].[NAMESPACE].svc.cluster.local, and every service can be accessed with that.\nThis poses a huge security risk but can be avoided by using special networking plugins in Kubernetes. Common plugins are Calico, Flannel, Weave, and Cilium. They can be set up to isolate namespaces, and containers, and specify different Security Groups and Access Control Lists as you might know from other cloud providers.\n2. Inter-Node communication in Kubernetes is encrypted A similar issue happens with the communication between Kubernetes nodes. Let us say you are encrypting your WordPress (or any other) traffic with automated Cert-Manager and Letsencrypt. All good, right? Wrong - because traffic in between nodes is unencrypted by default. But what does that mean?\nIf one node is located in Frankfurt, and another in Munich for availability reasons (good on you!), the communication between nodes still happens unencrypted. This means, that anyone gaining access to the data center connection could read your traffic!\nOf course, this is quite strongly prevented if your hosting provider is reliable, but especially if you are using self-hosted setups you should be careful in doing this. And what can you do against that? You could either manually use self-signed certificates for the pods, or - easier - use Kubernetes plugins for that. The previously mentioned networking plugins offer a lot of functionality. The plugins implement a so-called \u0026ldquo;service mash\u0026rdquo;, which deploys a sidecar along with your pod, that is taking care of TLS termination with mTLS enabled between pods.\nCalico does not implement this by default, but Linkerd and Istio can use traffic encryption in combination with Calico. Linkerd is the easiest plugin in these regards, as it implements mTLS out of the box.\n3. Velero Backups are secured and encrypted Say you have Backups implemented, and save them to AWS S3 for safekeeping. A good step for sure in terms of disaster recovery, but did you know, that Velero does not encrypt your backups by default? This can have serious implications if you are running an isolated self-hosted Kubernetes cluster because you are from the finance industry or store medical data, but the backup is stored in true form on an American cloud provider.\nMany European countries specify to not use American cloud providers due to security risks involved, and many still keep on using S3 for backups. If someone accesses these object storages in the public cloud, there is no encryption on the files stored.\nUnfortunately, at the time of writing, there is no Backup service offering encryption. My solution was to create custom Kubernetes Jobs, that dump the data, encrypt it in the Job, and then store it in object storage provider interfaces.\n4. Kubernetes secrets are encrypted You might have created secrets in Kubernetes, and might have taken a look at them in your running cluster. \u0026ldquo;aWxvdmV0ZW5kaWVz\u0026rdquo;, wow that looks quite encrypted! But again the hard truth is: Wrong! Kubernetes saves Secrets and a lot of other variables as base64 encoded strings. Base64 is just an encoding, and no encryption, meaning we can easily, without any keys, \u0026ldquo;translate\u0026rdquo; the above string into the true form. Try it out yourself with tools like e.g. https://www.base64encode.org/! This means, that if someone gets access to your Kubernetes cluster, he can just read all your secrets. This is currently not completely preventable, but good solutions exist.\nFor example \u0026ldquo;Sealed Secrets\u0026rdquo;, allow you to encrypt your secrets at rest and in transit on creation. The decryption key is stored in the cluster itself, which is where the secrets get decrypted. This still means though, that if the cluster itself gets compromised, the encryption key is compromised, but at least during creation and when storing the secrets on Github, they remain safe.\nA slightly more complex approach by Bitnami, the \u0026ldquo;Helm secrets\u0026rdquo;, can use a Key Management system like AWS KMS or Google CKM to encrypt and decrypt secrets. That way, you do not have to share the same encryption key with all your developers, but only specific developers have access to the encryption keys of their applications, even in the cluster.\nStill, the secrets remain \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; in the cluster itself, which is another reason to pay close attention to not losing your Admin Kubeconfig.\n5. Using the same user for everything This brings us to our next point. When creating new clusters your provider usually gives you one Kubeconfig file. This is the admin file, and you can do anything with it. Even though it is tempting, you should never use it except for creating other users and permissions. That way, if one user and role for a specific app or namespace gets compromised, it has no control over the others. The solution is called RBAC (role based access control).\nNumber 6 is only available in our free PDF Download of this article!!\n\r7. Ignoring resource limits I know, it is tempting to just write your deployments and publish them. But you should at least set namespace limits, or even better deployment resource limits, as this prevents you from a lot of headaches further down the road.\nKubernetes managed resources automatically, which is amazing, but if someone attacks one specific service of yours with a DDOS attack (basically a lot of traffic), the resources for that deployment will consume almost all Kubernetes resources and all the other applications will fail.\nThis can be troublesome if your organization uses one huge cluster without these limits. It does not even have to be an attack. It can be an application with bugs, that enters an infinite loop or just eats all the resources. The solution is to define deployment - or at least - namespace limits. That way, if a namespace reaches that hard limit, the application will be contained, and the other applications keep on running.\nI hope this list gave you a nice picture of what you can do to improve security in your Kubernetes deployment.

Next Video: Tech-Demo\n Did you know, that over 60% of development time is spent on DevOp tasks instead of working on the actual product [1]?\n\rWhat if there could be a way to \u0026ldquo;just run code\u0026rdquo; instead of worrying about servers and clusters?\nEasyFAAS (Easy-Function-as-a-service) lets you run your code in an easy environment, without hidden costs.\n  Get Started for free!   Why should I choose EasyFAAS over other providers? Whilst we were working with FAAS services of other providers, we usually ended up having problems with two specific things:\n (EU) Data Security Complexness  1. Our problems with (EU) Data Security Even though FAAS services of other cloud providers are technically secure, they still have the problem of being hosted by an american company. This can be a problem for EU-based companies, as the american \u0026ldquo;patriot act\u0026rdquo; states, that the US government can basically request your data from american companies to \u0026ldquo;intercept and obstruct terrorism\u0026rdquo;. There have been unconfirmed reports of misuse as well, where industry and intellectual secrets were requested.\nThis proves to be especially dangerours for companies in the finance industry, or in general where companies have an intellectual competitive advantage.\n\rOf course no one can surely say (yet) that this is really happening, and that it is not only used for the defeat of terrorism, but our company and many others agree that your data should only belong to you.\n2. Our problems with complexness Now back to a happier topic: The FAAS services of other cloud providers are amazing. They are versatile, well integrated in their system, and were a technological novelty. Our problem has just been, that if you want to \u0026ldquo;just get going\u0026rdquo;, meaning just pasting your code, you will often experience that it is not that easy.\nThe technical interconnections with other services come with a price: You will find yourself setting up API Gateways if you want the service to connect to the outside, where you will need to know about ports, firewalls, security groups and even networking.\nAlso, if you are using custom packages like Python\u0026rsquo;s numpy and pandas, you will have to create an extra layer, which proves to be quite complex, instead of just listing the packages that are used.\nOne of our main applications in the past has been to create little APIs that write and read from a database. In other FAAS solutions, this requires you to create the networking, the database connection and the custom layer to get started, which involved a lot of repetitive tasks.\nIn our EasyFAAS solution this becomes as simple as this:\nContents  Overview Serverless Function Types Managed MongoDB Getting started  EasyFAAS Main Dashboard Creating a new function Code Example: Bitcoin price getter The function Detail page   Billing  Introduction EasyFAAS reduces time to market, and let\u0026rsquo;s your programmers focus on what it important: your code!\nDid you know that you can run one function per month for free? Claim your free function\n\rTo achieve this EasyFAAS currently supports two functions:\n1. Serverless functions  Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; functions Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; functions  2. A managed MongoDB NoSQL database  Easy integration without much setup into your EasyFAAS functions  1. Serverless functions overview A \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from a \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; function, in that it offers persistence, meaning that if a function crashes, or restarts, that objects saved in the path \u0026quot;/mnt/persistent/\u0026quot; will be saved.\nA \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from the \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; function, in that the timed one is running at a specific schedule, whilst the continuous is running constantly.\nThese two settings can be combined, resulting in a total of four combinable possibilities for serverless functions:\n1.1 Simple-Continuous function  Good for web applications that do not require storage. Examples:  you want an API or website displayed where data does not have to be stored you want to download current crypto prices and calculate the exchange rate between two pairs    1.2. Simple-Timed function  Good for jobs that you want to have executed, that do not require storage Examples:  triggering other endpoints with post requests starting external backups downloading data and writing it into the managed MongoDB    1.3. Storage-Continuous function  Good for web applications that require storage. Examples:  An API that receives current users as json and saves them to disk An API or website that needs to save pictures to disk    1.4. Storage-Timed function  Good for jobs that require storage Examples:  You want to download price data every hour and save it into a CSV file You want to create backups of a database    2. Managed MongoDB overview In case storage on disk is not enough, you can easily spin up a managed mongodb instance, which you can easily access from your serverless functions.\nA managed MongoDB makes sense, if you want to run multiple functions that are all accessing the same information, like if you distributed your workloads into several functions, or you are running functions in parallel.\nThe big benefits of the managed MongoDB service are, that contrary to other hosting providers it will remain in a custom network, meaning it is not exposed to the internet, but you can still easily access it in your functions.\nThis means you do not have to worry about SSL connections, strong passwords or other things, and can easily get it up and running in seconds. An example to connect with python is as follows:\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient client = MongoClient(\u0026#39;mongodb://mongodb:27017/\u0026#39;) This saves you from a lot of steps compared to other hosting providers, where you need to set up SSL certificates, ports, firewalls and user password combinations.\nExample applications for the managed MongoDB are:\n You are saving items as json into MongoDB using custom EasyFAAS functions. If one function is not enough, you can simply scale your function up, and the load will be distributed to two functions automatically. You are building an ETL pipeline, where the first function collects data and saves it into the database, the second applies calculations to it and writes it again into the database, and the third one serves the result as an API  1. Getting started EasyFAAS currently only supports Python, but we have Node, React and others already implemented. Tell us about your code preferences and we might be able to get it working.\n\r1.1 The main dashboard Head over to https://shop.easycloudhost.de/contact/ and register or login.\n  The main dashboard is the central control system for EasyFAAS. In here, you will se an overview over the different services that are available.\n1.2 Create a new function Next click on New function, which takes you to the function type selection screen.\nWhat is a timed, and what is a continuous function?\n\rA timed function is best suited for jobs that do not need to run all the time, but rather run at specific intervals. If you have used Cron in the past, this is pretty much it. You can define Cron schedules as you are used to, like for example    Cron expression   Meaning    30 2 * * * Every day at 2:30   30 * * * * Every day, every hour at :30 (2:30, 3:30, 4:30 ...)   01 2 1 * * 2:01 on the first of every month   I like to use the website https://crontab.guru/ to check my expressions\n\r A continuous function runs all the time, and is best used if you want a webservice or API to run.  \r 1.3 The create function screen For this tutorial I went with a continuous function\nLet us take a look at the differnet elements\n1.3.1 Setup elements Function name\nThis can be whatever you want. The function name will later be converted to a lower-case, \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; seperated form. Like \u0026ldquo;My awesome FuNcTiOn\u0026rdquo; will become \u0026ldquo;my-awesome-function\u0026rdquo;.\nFunction count\nThis is where scalability comes into play. For now leave function count at 1, but if you later on experience that you need more power, you can easily up-scale your function here.\nPIP requirements\nNow instead of creating a layer for your FAAS function, you can just enter your pip packages here, and it will automatically install them. Easy as that.\nDebian requirements\nAll functions are build in Debian. Meaning you can easily install any Debian package if you need it. If you have installed it on your local system with \u0026ldquo;apt install \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; you can list it here. This is useful if you might need some system based tools like imagemagic, wkhtml and others. This is actually not supported yet in other FAAS services.\nVisibility\nYour EasyFAAS function comes with security enabled by default. If your function is public, it will be accessible for everyone. If it is private, you will need to send an auth token to the endpoint. Does that mean you need to create new users and everything? No, you can just get an auth token using our RestAPI using your normal user and password, and then use that token to fire towards your function. Easy as that.\nFunction type\nThere are different functions to choose from. The selection are simple function and storage function.\nThey are distinguishable in the way, that a storage function has persistence, whilst a normal function has not.\nPersistence means that if your function writes data to the disk, it will be safe.\nDo you write or read from a local file? Like a .csv, or .txt file? Then you will need persistence. If your function just calculates and does not write or read anything, you can choose a simple function\n\rPersistence is enabled at the directory /mnt/persistence/, and not in other directories.\nThis means you can still read and write temporary files in both versions, but only persist them if they are written to the /mnt/persistence path.\n\rNo persistence   with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"w\") as file: file.write(\"my temporary data\") with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"r\") as file: data = file.read() #   Persistence at /mnt/persistence/   with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"w\") as file: file.write(\"my temporary data\") with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"r\") as file: data = file.read() #   \r 1.3.1 Code This is the core part of your function.\nYour function is using FastAPI in the background, but you do not have to worry about much if you use the already inserted starter code:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request app = FastAPI()  # basic usage @app.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def root():  return {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;}  # post requests @app.post(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def rootPost(request: Request):  data = await request.json()  print(data)  return {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;I got the post: \u0026#34; + str(data)} The EasyFAAS function only supports routing to the root domain \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;. Meaning if you create different routes they will not be used.\nWhat you can change though, is the request type. It can be GET or POST, as well as the others. For most of the use-cases GET and POST should be enough though.\nIf you want to adapt your code you can easily just add your calculations and functions inside the \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; function.\nLet us take a look at some examples\nCode example: Bitcoin Price getter  Use a newer browser to see this video.  Previous Video: EasyFAAS Intro\n Let us say you want to create a small route that just returns the current price of Bitcoin. We are using the free coingecko route for it.\nWe will adapt the code to look like this:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI import requests  base_url = \u0026#34;https://api.binance.com/api/v3\u0026#34;  app = FastAPI()  def getCoingeckoPrice(symbol):  url = base_url + f\u0026#34;/avgPrice?symbol={symbol}USDT\u0026#34;  r = requests.get(url)  return r.json()   # basic usage @app.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def root():  return getCoingeckoPrice(\u0026#34;BTC\u0026#34;) As we want to run this function continuously, and it does not need to save data anywhere, we will choose a continuous and simple function.\nAfter clicking on \u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo;, you will be taken back to the mainscreen, where you will see your function.\nThen, click on \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026rdquo; next to you function which will take you to the function detail screen.\nFunction Detail Page We can see a lot of information in here, but let us first just click on the link provided at \u0026ldquo;Link\u0026rdquo;. In this case, it is: https://api.easyfaas.de/functions/route/public/de96cbb3-aead-4485-9889-a76a92a8a719/function-name\nWhen I am clicking on it, it returns:\n{ \u0026#34;status_code\u0026#34;: 200, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ok\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;mins\\\u0026#34;: 5, \\\u0026#34;price\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;19756.28232097\\\u0026#34;}\u0026#34; } The \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; response of our function is located at the message key in the dictionary. Why is that? We want some kind of check if the request was really successful, or if not, some kind of error message.\nSo if your application is querying your EasyFAAS route, it should always check for the \u0026ldquo;status_code\u0026rdquo; part. If the function is failing, it will return for example code 500 together with an error message in the \u0026ldquo;status\u0026rdquo; part.\nAn example on how your application would query the EasyFAAS route is:\nimport requests  response = requests.get(\u0026#34;https://api.easyfaas.de/functions/route/public/de96cbb3-aead-4485-9889-a76a92a8a719/function-name\u0026#34;) if response.status_code != 200:  raise Exception(\u0026#34;error in EasyFAAS function: \u0026#34; + str(response.text)) else:  response = response.json()  message = json.loads(response[\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;])  print(message)  price = float(message[\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;]) Function Detail Page: Logs If you take a closer look at the function detail page you will see a \u0026ldquo;logs\u0026rdquo; section.\nIn here, everything that your function code returns will be shown. If you refresh the page it will refresh the current logs. If you function is not responsive you will see the reason why in here.\nFunction Detail Page: Metrics Metrics show you how much of the resources your function is using. If you require more \u0026ldquo;power\u0026rdquo;, maybe EasyHost or EasyScale is something for you. Otherwise just contact us.\nEasyFAAS billing You might have read the word \u0026ldquo;credits\u0026rdquo; quite often by now. What does it mean?\nEasyFAAS simplifies billing, in that it charges \u0026ldquo;credits\u0026rdquo; instead of usage-based fees. With other cloud providers, you often do not have the full transparency on what will be charged at the end of the month. There are hidden traffic fees, hidden load balancer fees and way more that you can not foresee unless you run the numbers.\nEasyFAAS solves that, in that it simplifies billing to:\n   Function Type Credit cost per Month Euro value     Simple function 1 2€   Storage function 2 4€   Managed MongoDB 5 10€    No hidden fees, no nothing. In future updates we will even include autoscaling based on the remaining credits in your account, meaning that if you have more credits than functions, and a function is close to it\u0026rsquo;s limit, it will scale up to e.g. 2 functions instead of one.\nBilling is done via Stripe, a secure and reliable payment provider.\n Get Started for free!

Just imagine the benefit for advertising or insurances, if companies would know about all the illnesses of a person. And especially how much people woud be willing to pay for a snake oil cure that promises instant relief.\nEvil employers would benefit as well, being able to \u0026ldquo;kick out\u0026rdquo; ill or pregnant people in time.\nEven though these are hopefully still science fiction scenarios, you can easily see why hackers target clinics and healthcare providers.\nLet us look at some numbers:\n2,550 data breaches have compromised over 189 million healthcare records in the last decade.\n\r89% of healthcare providers have undergone a data breach.\n\rCyber threats are expected to hit $6 trillion in losses by 2021.\n\rSource\nReasons for breaches Oftentimes the reasons for a databreach can be broken down into:\n Software that is not updated Servers that are not isolated (on-premise) Wrong usage of the public cloud Missing backups Bad networking setups  Usually clinics and healthcare providers focus their time and effort somewhere else, and end up just installing software once, never updating it. Same as your phone and computer updates, the clinic systems should be updated as well to patch new security leaks. There is a whole industry designed to discover new security leaks in applications and software, and sell them as \u0026ldquo;zero day exploits\u0026rdquo; to the highest bidder. Of course these leaks get \u0026ldquo;patched\u0026rdquo;(fixed), but if no one install the update, the well known exploit will always remain open for everyone to use.\nAdditionally, a lot of people do not implement the matching security measures when using the public cloud, leaving ports and machines open for everyone to access.\nLegal challenges when storing patient data Due to these breaches, both the US and EU have implemented strict laws regarding storage of healthcare data.\nIn the US, this protocol is called \u0026ldquo;HIPAA\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u0026rdquo; in the longform.\nIn Germany and the EU, these specifications are divided into the general part called \u0026ldquo;GDPR\u0026rdquo; (The General Data Protection Regulation) and further laws defined by each state, like the \u0026ldquo;BayKrG\u0026rdquo; (Bayrisches Krankenhausgesetz).\nEven though there are complex sections, they can be basically summarized for both as:\n1. Encrypting data  Data should always be encrypted both on the disk, as well as in transport (SSL)  2. Let users only see what is necessary  A nurse should only see medical data she needs Someone from accounting should only see \u0026ldquo;numbers\u0026rdquo; etc.  3.

The fall and rise of static sites Why website speed is important EasyHost: Uniting both worlds Portfolio Pricing  What makes EasyHost different? Our secret is simple: Simplicity\nSimplicity both in terms of user experience, as well as in hosting.\nLooking for Website Programming? Head over to Websites\n\rThe fall and rise of static sites Remember the beginning of the web, with their horrible layouts, extreme colors and just pure craziness?\n Amazon back in the day\n The design and usability was horrible, and also just having to change small details of the page required re-loading the whole website, which slows down the user-experience a lot.\nThis is why new technologies like Ajax were invented, to only load tiny parts of information into the website, instead of re-loading the whole deal.\nThe web became more and more dynamic, and WordPress became the dominating CMS for both shops and blogs alike. WordPress introduced huge changes to the web, like being able to just write a blog post, without having to program a whole html website if you wanted a new page to show on your website.\nThis comes with a huge disadvantage though: The server needs to \u0026ldquo;calculate\u0026rdquo; how the final website looks like. You can imagine the WordPress working process like this:\n User opens a website WordPress queries the database to check if we have a blog post for that website If the content exists, load it from the database Grab the \u0026ldquo;Blog posts\u0026rdquo; template and insert that information in there Return the final calculated website to the user  As you can see, this is causing a lot of steps to do for the server, especially if millions of people access the website.\nWhy website speed is important  Sources: LoadStorm\n As you can see above, speed is essential nowadays. Attention is shortlived, and if people have to wait too long for a shop or website to load, they will simply leave.\nNow the big question is: Are they more likely to buy on your fancy WordPress website or on that fast, horrible 90s one?\nUniting both worlds: EasyHost The answer is simple: You can have both.\nRecent websites use Javascript and rely more and more on HTML, which differs from how websites like WordPress work. The main difference is, that new web technologies do the calculations in the browser of the user, opposed to on your server.\nIf we are going back to the example before - this is how EasyHost works:\n User opens a website The browser loads HTML, Javascript and CSS from the server, which are basically just small leightweight text documents These documents contain information how the website looks like, think of it as a blueprint The browser \u0026ldquo;builds\u0026rdquo; the website following the recipe You will see the final result in your browser  Taking it a step further with EasyHost Of course, it is not that simple. Javascript, React and NextJS still query a lot of information from APIs and servers, which adds a lot of delays again, and adds load to your servers. It is better than the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; dynamic web, but still kind of slow, especially when scaling.\nLet us say your server has to be located in Germany, with no CDN available for cost and compliance reasons.\nNow even if a user in Australia accesses the website, gets the \u0026ldquo;blueprint\u0026rdquo;, but still needs to query your API for information, loading times become quite slow. Then again, you could add your API servers all over the world, and query only the closest server for that information \u0026hellip; but isn\u0026rsquo;t there a simpler way to do it?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t we just offload the whole work to the users browser?\nThe answer is yes. With EasyHost your websites are basically \u0026ldquo;pre-rendered\u0026rdquo;, like if someone programs a page in pure HTML, offloading the whole work to the users browser. The only information that is queried from your or our server will be the \u0026ldquo;blueprint\u0026rdquo; and images.\nDoes that mean I have to program each page manually? Of course not. You can still use a CMS (content management system) like WordPress, or write text directly in Markdown like I do now, and EasyHost \u0026ldquo;converts\u0026rdquo; this to a nice website and pushes it to the server.\n Writing this text in Markdown\n   Free 15-min consultation on how EasyHost can work for you    Using the CMS\n Some examples of EasyHost in action    Website name Type Example URL     EasyCloudHost.de Company site, Blog, Shop  https://easycloudhost.de/   DataFortress.cloud Company site, Blog  https://datafortress.cloud/   BildBlatt.de WordPress Shop turned static  https://bildblatt.de/   GoodThings4U Complete Static Shop  https://goodthings4u.com/     The advantages of EasyHost / Pricing Now that we know that our websites will load super quick, and our revenues will increase, you will surely tell us that this will cost a hundred bucks a month, right?\nNo. As EasyHost is up to a 1000x lighter on the server you will save a lot of money on hosting.\n  Free 15-min consultation on how EasyHost can work for you  ","date":"01","image":null,"permalink":"/services/easyhost/","tags":null,"title":"EasyHost"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Use a newer browser to see this video.

The advantages of a custom private cloud So, why should you care to create your own cloud, instead of using public cloud providers?\nThere are several advantages and disadvantages depending on your background. Let us say you store sensitive, intellectual data, like patents or data that gives you a competitive advantage. As you might know, the Patriot Act comes with the problem, that US cloud providers have to give your data to the US government if it is supposed to be linked to terrorism.\nBut even if that is not the case, there are laws for clinics or healthcare providers that force you to host your data in Germany, or at least the EU.\nDoes this mean I have to use a \u0026ldquo;lesser\u0026rdquo; cloud to comply and protect data? \u0026ldquo;lesser\u0026rdquo; is not the case, as Kubernetes is actually offering you a lot of technical advantages over public clouds. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out!\nTop 5 reasons to use a private cloud over the public cloud 1. No vendor lock Public clouds offer you fully integrated products, like serverless functions, that are incompatible with other clouds. Even though it\u0026rsquo;s easy, as they are ready to use in seconds, it comes as a surprise if the cloud provider increases the prices. Should you re-build your whole architecture to fit into another cloud? Or would you rather \u0026ldquo;suck it up\u0026rdquo;, and pay the increased price?\nTo avoid this situation, you should always be able to \u0026ldquo;plug and play\u0026rdquo; your applications, switching providers like your fuel station. This is possible if you are using frameworks like Kubernetes and EasyKube.\nYou are writing your applications as code, called IAAS (infrastructure as code), using barebones Kubernetes yaml files, or more complex Terraform scripts.\nIf the cloud provider increases their rates, you can just move to antother one in seconds.\n2. Your data in your hands In the last 18 months, 79% of companies have experienced at least one cloud data breach; even more alarmingly, 43% have reported 10 or more breaches in that time. Source\n\rMany companies who move to the public cloud have previously hosted their applications and data on a local machine, mostly isolated from the internet. What works in a private, secured room is not working in the public cloud though.\nThis is why many companies leave ports open that should be closed, or access their cloud via insecure channels. A password like \u0026ldquo;Tommie123\u0026rdquo; might work in a local network, where only 30 people have access, but not in the public cloud, where millions of bots constantly scan for security leaks.\nIf you are using EasyKube and Kubernetes, your data runs on your private servers, that you can even completely isolate from the internet if you want. Additionally, EasyKube comes with integrated security features like:\n SSL certificates (Letsencrypt) Automatic HTTPS forwarding (even if you try to run HTTP) Port isolation. Only port 80 and 443 (internet) are open by default  3. No unexpected costs Even though prices seem to be comparable to in-house hosting, the public cloud can cause unexpected costs. This is due to the fact, that oftentimes traffic is charged on top, or logging and monitoring cost extra. All this is automatically integrated if you are using Kubernetes and EasyKube.\nLet us take a look at an example. If you are hosting a website in a virtual instance, the usual price for a 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM machine is around 10$. This seems okay, but even having ~10.000 visitors a month pushes traffic costs to around 50$, which increases the initial cost of 10$ to 60$ total. And this does not even include backups, logging and monitoring. All this is integrated in Kubernetes and EasyKube by default.\n4. Simplicity Even though public cloud providers offer a huge variety of services, they become quite complex if everything needs to be connected with each other. Let us say you just want to deploy a simple website in a virtual machine.\nIf you are starting the machine, you need to create security groups, networking, permissions, volumes, zones and connections, which are partially unavailable because some services are only supported in some regions\u0026hellip; And then it is throwing an error because your user does not have enough permissions. What permission do I need? \u0026hellip;\nEasyKube saves you a lot of headache, because we are breaking down the complexity. With EasyKube you can actually deploy a whole application, including networking, persistence and domain based routing in less than 80 lines of code, where most is just copy-and-paste.\n5. Cost savings Whilst a public cloud cluster starts at at least 140€ a month, we are starting as low as 10$! Also our general cost is about a tenth of the public cloud Kubernetes cost.\n  Free Demo to see EasyKube in action!   The simplicity of EasyKube Let us take a look at an example to use EasyKube. EasyKube supports:\n Persistent Volumes - backed up to 3 availability zones Horizontal Autoscaling - Scale your applications depending on the load HTTPS by default, with certificates by LetsEncrypt Easy Domain Routing with both our and your custom domain Auto updating Nodes - Avoid security breaches with old nodes Up to Date Kubernetes - Auto-updating Kubernetes Load Balancers - Use load balancers instead of Domain routing if you want Two data centers in Germany - to get reliant nodes.

Top 5 reasons for slow applications Traditional applications are created as huge, single-application programs. Whilst this is speeding up development, it scales really bad.\n Monolithic vs Microservice architecture. Image by Rancher\n You might be asking yourself: Why is my application or website so slow? Usually it is breaking down to 4 simple reasons.\n1. No Multiprocessing If your application is for example not supporting multiprocessing, it can only run one function at a time. Let us say you are querying a database every time a link is called. If no multiprocessing is used, only one piece of data can be retrieved from the database at a time, with the other ones being \u0026ldquo;on hold\u0026rdquo;.\n2. No Decoupling Additionally, imagine one part of your application failing. Will this block all the other parts until your applications comes back online? If no decoupling is happening the answer is yes.\nThe answer is called decoupling. Decoupling means, you are splitting your application into smaller microservices, that only do one thing, and connect them with a message queue like RabbitMQ, such that one failing part of your application is not affecting other parts.\nAnother nice benefit of this is, that server resources can be distributed to the part where they are required the most right now. Let us say you do not have much traffic on the frontend, as only some users visit your website right now, but a lot of load on backend calculations. In traditional applications each part would only have an equal part of the resources, which means the frontend is idling, whilst the backend is overloaded.\nWhen splitting up your application into Microservices, the load is automatically distributed to where it matters most. Meaning that in our example, the frontend will have fewer resources than the backend, at least for this moment where it is required.\n3. Slow Databases Then, a lot of SQL databases do not support horizontal scaling. This means, that you can only buy a bigger and bigger server, which tends to get quite expensive as only mass-produced servers (smaller ones) are cheap to use. Horizontal scaling means having a lot of \u0026ldquo;smaller\u0026rdquo; servers, that each run the same databases. There are databases that support horizontal scaling, like MongoDB and EasyDB, which can help reduce cost and speed up slow databases.\n4. No distributed computing You should never run software on just one server. If that server is either slow or completely offline, your application will fail.\nThe goal is, to distribute your application over several servers. This can be done with either using a FAAS Framework like EasyFAAS or AWS Lambda, or to use a container management framework like EasyKube or Kubernetes.\nThat way, when one server becomes slow or offline, your applications will automatically be switched to another server.\n5. No autoscaling Closely related to the previous point, there are ways to let your application scale to the demand. This is called autoscaling. Let us take the classic \u0026ldquo;Prime day\u0026rdquo; example. Once a year, Amazon is offering a huge sale, which results in over 100 times the normal server load. Then on other days, like christmas, traffic is almost nonexistent, leaving servers idle.\nThe traditional solution would be, to just buy a huge server that can handle the \u0026ldquo;Prime day\u0026rdquo;. But this causes it to be idle on 90% of the days, causing a lot of unnecessary costs. The other way would be to just \u0026ldquo;ignore\u0026rdquo; traffic peaks and loose those additional customers, which is not ideal either.\nThe answer is to let the Application scale to the current demand. This can be achieved with a FAAS Framework like EasyFAAS or AWS Lambda, or with using a container management framework like EasyKube or Kubernetes.\nHow can I scale my application?

Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of DataFortress.cloud. The use of the Internet pages of DataFortress.cloud is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.\nThe processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to DataFortress.cloud. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.\nAs the controller, DataFortress.cloud has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.\nDefinitions The data protection declaration of DataFortress.cloud is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used. In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:\na) Personal data Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\nb) Data subject Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.\nc) Processing Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.\nd) Restriction of processing Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.\ne) Profiling Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.\nf) Pseudonymisation Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\ng) Controller or controller responsible for the processing Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.\nh) Processor Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.\ni) Recipient Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.\nj) Third party Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.\nk) Consent Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\nName and Address of the controller Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is: DataFortress.cloud\nSchönbrunner Straße 266\n1120 Vienna\nAustria\nPhone: +43 677 61178288\nEmail: info@datafortress.cloud Website: https://www.datafotress.cloud\nCookies The Internet pages of DataFortress.cloud use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.\nCookie\tDescription\tDuration\tType _ga\tThis cookie is installed by Google Analytics. The cookie is used to calculate visitor, session, campaign data and keep track of site usage for the site’s analytics report. The cookies store information anonymously and assign a randomly generated number to identify unique visitors.\t2 years\tAnalytics _gid\tThis cookie is installed by Google Analytics. The cookie is used to store information of how visitors use a website and helps in creating an analytics report of how the wbsite is doing. The data collected including the number visitors, the source where they have come from, and the pages viisted in an anonymous form.\t1 day\tAnalytics _gat\tThis cookies is installed by Google Universal Analytics to throttle the request rate to limit the colllection of data on high traffic sites.\t1 minute\tPerformance CookieScriptConsent\tNeeded to track cookie choice\t1 day\tPerformance Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.\nThrough the use of cookies, DataFortress.cloud can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.\nBy means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.\nThe data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.\nCollection of general data and information The website of DataFortress.cloud collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems. When using these general data and information, DataFortress.cloud does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, DataFortress.cloud analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.\nSubscription to our newsletters On the website of DataFortress.cloud, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise’s newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller. DataFortress.cloud informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.\nDuring the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.\nThe personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.\nNewsletter-Tracking The newsletter of DataFortress.cloud contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, DataFortress.cloud may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects. Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. DataFortress.cloud automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.\nContact possibility via the website The website of DataFortress.cloud contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.\nComments function in the blog on the website DataFortress.cloud offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented by third parties.\nIf a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on the user’s (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.\nSubscription to comments in the blog on the website The comments made in the blog of DataFortress.cloud may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular blog post. If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to. If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.\nRights of the data subject a) Right of confirmation Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. b) Right of access Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information:\nthe purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing; the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nc) Right to rectification Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\nIf a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nd) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:\nThe personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by DataFortress.cloud, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of DataFortress.cloud shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.\nWhere the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of DataFortress.cloud will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.\ne) Right of restriction of processing Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:\nThe accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by DataFortress.cloud, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of DataFortress.cloud will arrange the restriction of the processing.\nf) Right to data portability Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\nFurthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\nIn order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of DataFortress.cloud.\ng) Right to object Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.\nDataFortress.cloud shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nIf DataFortress.cloud processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to DataFortress.cloud to the processing for direct marketing purposes, DataFortress.cloud will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.\nIn addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by DataFortress.cloud for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\nIn order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of DataFortress.cloud. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.\nh) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject’s explicit consent.\nIf the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit consent, DataFortress.cloud shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of DataFortress.cloud.\ni) Right to withdraw data protection consent Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of DataFortress.cloud.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network. A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.\nThe operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the “Like” button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\nFacebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.\nThe data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of functions of the Amazon Partner program On this website, the controller has integrated Amazon components as a participant in the Amazon partner program. The Amazon components were created by Amazon with the aim to mediate customers through advertisements on various websites of the Amazon group, in particular Amazon.co.uk, Local.Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, BuyVIP.com, Amazon.de, Amazon.it and Amazon.es in return for the payment of a commission. By using the Amazon components, the controller may generate advertising revenue. The operating company of this Amazon component is Amazon EU S.à.r.l, 5 Rue Plaetis, L-2338 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.\nAmazon sets a cookie the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With each single call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and in which an Amazon component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Amazon through the respective Amazon component. During the course of this technical procedure, Amazon receives personal information that is used to trace the origin of orders from Amazon, and as a result, to allow the accounting of a commission. Among other things, Amazon may understand that the data subject has clicked on an affiliate link on our website.\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used, and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Amazon from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Amazon may be deleted at anytime via a web browser or other software programs.\nFurther information and the actual data protection provisions of Amazon may be retrieved under https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=3312401\u0026amp;language=en_GB.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function) On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising. The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.\nFor the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application “_gat. _anonymizeIp”. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nThe purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.\nGoogle Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.\nThe cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.\nIn addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet advertising that allows the advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google’s search results only then displayed, when the user utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into account the previously defined keywords. The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.\nThe purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website.\nIf a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of goods.\nThe data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.\nThe conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\nThe data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.\nThe data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link www.google.de/settings/ads and set the desired settings.\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram.

If such a transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not desirable for the data subject, the delivery may be prevented if the data subject logs off from their own YouTube account before a call-up to our website is made.\nYouTube’s data protection provisions, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, provide information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.\nLegal basis for the processing Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\nThe legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\nPeriod for which the personal data will be stored The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\nExistence of automated decision-making As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.\nThis Privacy Policy has been generated by the Privacy Policy Generator of the DGD – Your External DPO that was developed in cooperation with German Lawyers from WILDE BEUGER SOLMECKE, Cologne.\n","date":"01","image":null,"permalink":"/privacy-policy/","tags":null,"title":"Privacy \u0026 Policy"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Our customer portal is currently under maintenance :( Please create a ticket below and we will manually cancel / edit any subscriptions:\n","date":"01","image":null,"permalink":"/subscription-management/","tags":null,"title":"Subscription management"},{"categories":null,"contents":"General Terms and Conditions of DataFortress.cloud UG Preamble: DataFortress.cloud UG (hereinafter \u0026ldquo;DataFortress\u0026rdquo;), Georgenstraße 13, 86152 Augsburg, offers services in the field of web hosting.

The software, the computing power required for its use and the necessary storage and data processing space are provided by DataFortress. The software remains on servers for which DataFortress is responsible. DataFortress is not responsible for establishing and maintaining the data connection between the Customer\u0026rsquo;s IT system and the aforementioned transfer point.\n4.2 Insofar as the software runs exclusively on the servers of DataFortress or of a service provider commissioned by DataFortress, the Customer does not require any copyright usage rights to the software, nor does DataFortress grant any such rights. However, DataFortress grants the Customer, for the term of the agreement, the non-exclusive, non-transferable right, limited in time to the term of the user agreement, to load the user interface of the software for display on the screen into the main memory of the end devices used for this purpose in accordance with the agreement and to make the resulting reproductions of the user interface.\n4.3 With respect to DataFortress software, the customer acquires the right to access DataFortress software to the extent stipulated in the contract during the term of the contract and to use it for the purposes stipulated in the contract.\n5 Availability 5.1 The availability of the servers, if applicable, the software and the data paths up to the transfer point to the Internet is 99.5% per year less the time required for the installation of updates, upgrades, new releases and/or other modifications, unless otherwise agreed in the appendices to the respective valid Service Level Agreements and product-specific Service Level Agreements.\n5.2 DataFortress draws the Customer\u0026rsquo;s attention to the fact that restrictions or impairments of the services provided may arise that are beyond DataFortress\u0026rsquo; control. This includes, in particular, actions of third parties not acting on behalf of DataFortress, technical conditions of the Internet that cannot be influenced by DataFortress as well as force majeure. Also the hardware and software or technical infrastructure used by the customer can have an influence on the services of DataFortress. Insofar as such circumstances have an influence on the availability or functionality of the service provided by DataFortress, this has no effect on the contractual conformity of the services provided.\n5.3 The Customer is obligated to notify DataFortress immediately and as precisely as possible of any functional failures, malfunctions or impairments.

The parties agree that DataFortress neither owes a domain search nor the success of the registration procedure.  7.2 DataFortress does not carry out any legal or content-related examination of the domains to be registered. In particular, DataFortress does not assume any examination as to whether and to what extent a registration is actually or legally possible and permissible. The customer has to carry out the corresponding checks himself or have them carried out. The customer is responsible for checking which registration rules apply at the respective registry.\nrights to individual work results Insofar as DataFortress develops individually protectable contents for the customer (for example scripts or certificates), DataFortress grants the customer an exclusive right of use to the order results individually developed and/or provided for the customer (\u0026ldquo;work results\u0026rdquo;). DataFortress transfers to the customer the exclusive, content, temporally and spatially unlimited and irrevocable right of use to these work results for all known and unknown types of use, including the right to process the work results in any way.  9 Obligations of the Customer 9.1 The Customer undertakes vis-à-vis DataFortress to perform the acts of cooperation required for the provision of the agreed services. In particular, the customer shall provide all necessary information and documents free of charge and shall designate a contact person who is professionally qualified and has sufficient authorizations for the performance of the contract. Submitted information and documents serve as an essential basis for the implementation services of DataFortress. The provision of incorrect or incomplete information shall be at the Customer\u0026rsquo;s expense.\n9.2 The Customer shall itself back up data and information, including those processed on IT systems for which DataFortress is responsible.

Data on shared storage systems (e.g., NFS servers), will be backed up daily and the backups will be retained for three days, provided that the backup of the data does not exceed 20 hours.\n9.3 If DataFortress receives materials, data and other information (\u0026ldquo;Customer Materials\u0026rdquo;) from the Customer in the course of the performance of the Agreement, the Customer shall ensure that a copy of the data remains with the Customer for backup purposes. The Customer shall also ensure that data stored on DataFortress\u0026rsquo; systems are free of any malware.\n9.4 Insofar as the Customer provides DataFortress with protected content (e.g. graphics, trademarks and other content protected by copyright or trademark law), the Customer shall grant DataFortress all rights necessary for the performance of the contractual agreement. This includes, in particular, the right to make the relevant content available to the public. In this context, the customer assures that he owns all necessary rights to customer materials provided in order to grant DataFortress the corresponding rights.\n9.5 DataFortress shall be released from the obligation to provide the contractual services if and to the extent that the Customer fails to comply with its duties to cooperate. Any existing schedules shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. If the Customer is responsible for the failure to provide the cooperation service and if DataFortress suffers damage as a result, the Customer shall compensate DataFortress for such damage.\nexemption 10.1 As a technical service provider, DataFortress stores content and data for the Customer, which the Customer enters and stores and makes available for retrieval when using the contractual services. The Customer undertakes vis-à-vis DataFortress not to post any content and data that is punishable by law or otherwise illegal in absolute terms or in relation to individual third parties. The customer remains the responsible party with regard to personal data and must therefore always check whether the processing of such data via the use of the software is supported by the corresponding permissions.  10.2 The Customer is solely responsible for all content and processed data made available by it as well as any legal positions required for this.

Change requests are accepted on weekdays, Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and documented in the ticket system.  11.2 Changes to the content of the owed service (e.g. the use of additional offers) can also be ordered via the ticket system.\nSuch a change request shall contain at least the following information:\nDescription of the desired change; Meaning and purpose of the requested change; Special circumstances and background to be considered with regard to the requested change; Urgency of the requested change.\n11.3 DataFortress shall then immediately check what effects the desired change will have on the contractual service structure, in particular with regard to the agreed remuneration. If DataFortress determines that the change request can be implemented without further ado, the change will be implemented and documented in the ticket system.\n11.4 If DataFortress determines that services to be rendered cannot be performed or can only be performed with a delay due to the expected review effort for the change, DataFortress shall notify the customer of this and point out to the customer that the change request can only be further reviewed if the affected services are postponed accordingly. If the customer declares his agreement with this postponement, DataFortress will carry out the review of the change request. If, on the other hand, the customer withdraws its change request, the initiated change request procedure ends.\n11.5 To the extent that the change request cannot be implemented immediately and without additional consultation with the customer, DataFortress shall, after reviewing the change request, present to the customer the effects of the change request on the agreements made. The explanation shall contain either a proposal for the implementation of the change request or information as to why the change request cannot be implemented. The parties shall immediately agree on the content of a proposal for the implementation of the change request and fix the result of a successful agreement in a supplementary agreement. If no agreement is reached or if the change request procedure ends for any other reason, the original service content and scope shall remain in effect. (Such supplements only exist in exceptional cases. The business is too dynamic for that in many cases).\n11.6 The customer shall bear the expenses incurred as a result of the change request. This includes in particular the expenses for the examination of the change request, the preparation of a change proposal and any downtimes. The applicable hourly rate for this shall be based on the price list valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract.\n11.7 DataFortress is entitled to change or deviate from the scope of its services in order to ensure the provision of its services under this agreement and, in particular, to release larger volumes, even without a previously explicitly issued order by the customer. DataFortress will notify the customer of such changes immediately after they are made. After notification, the customer may reject the changes or deviations or additionally provided services. If the customer does not object to the changes or deviations after corresponding notification by DataFortress within two weeks after receipt of the notification, DataFortress will invoice the services rendered according to the respective valid price list. If the Customer does not object in text form within the aforementioned period, the change, deviation or additionally rendered service shall be deemed approved.\n11.8 If the catalog of services has to be changed due to an act of cooperation not undertaken by the Customer, in particular due to the correction of information already provided up to the time of acceptance or as a result of the subsequent submission of information, this shall be deemed to be a change in services in accordance with this Section 11.\n12 Remuneration; payment and invoicing modalities 12.1 Invoicing shall be based on the volume used or the services booked. Booked resources such as servers as well as agreed flat rates shall be invoiced monthly in advance, services which are invoiced according to consumption, such as traffic, shall be invoiced subsequently. The prices are based on the price list valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract.\n12.2 Unless otherwise indicated, prices quoted by DataFortress are subject to the applicable statutory value-added tax. The remuneration is based on the price list valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Additional services which are subject to a charge and which the customer makes use of after conclusion of the contract shall be remunerated in accordance with the price list valid at that time or in accordance with the agreement of the parties.\n12.3 If a fixed price is agreed as a one-time payment, it shall be due for payment without a discount upon receipt of the invoice. If payment of the fixed price in installments is agreed, the agreed installment shall be due for payment upon receipt of the partial invoice without any further discount.\n12.4 If the agreed service is remunerated on a time and material basis, the invoice shall be issued monthly in arrears for the previous month. The invoice shall be issued on the basis of written proof of performance, which shall be attached to the invoice. Services that are billed on a time basis, e.g. in the area of Managed Services, are documented by DataFortress with the smallest unit of 15 minutes. The performance records are considered accepted if the Client does not object to them within a maximum of 5 working days after receipt.\n12.5 In the case of term contracts, DataFortress can adjust the prices as well as the rates for an agreed remuneration according to the general price development after the expiry of the initially agreed contract term. If the fee increase amounts to more than 5%, the customer may terminate the contractual relationship with a notice period of five working days. The notice of termination shall be given within 14 days after the announcement of the increase.\n12.6 In the case of agreed partial services and for partial invoices, the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply accordingly.\n12.7 Invoices shall be sent electronically as PDF files. A fee shall be charged for mailing. Invoices shall be due for payment without deduction immediately upon receipt. The conditions and consequences of default shall be governed by the statutory provisions. If a due payment of a customer is more than three months overdue or has been reminded for the third time, DataFortress reserves the right to discontinue its own services or to block access to the service. If a partial amount of an invoice is disputed, the undisputed part shall always be paid.\n12.8 Both contracting parties are only entitled to set-off with legally established or undisputed claims that are due and such that arise from the same legal relationship and have arisen from a claim that would have entitled the creditor of the counterclaim to assert a right of retention or a right to refuse performance.\n13 Liability 13.1 DataFortress is liable for damages of the Customer caused intentionally or by gross negligence, which are the consequence of the non-existence of a guaranteed quality of the object of performance, which are based on a culpable violation of essential contractual obligations (so-called cardinal obligations, see Section 13.2), which are the consequence of culpable injury to health, body or life or for which liability is provided for under the Product Liability Act, in accordance with the statutory provisions.\n13.2 Cardinal obligations are those contractual obligations the fulfillment of which makes the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and the observance of which the contractual partner may regularly rely on, and the violation of which on the other hand endangers the achievement of the purpose of the contract.\n13.3 In the event of a breach of a cardinal obligation, liability - insofar as the damage is based solely on simple negligence and does not affect life, limb or health - is limited to such damage that is foreseeable and can typically be expected to occur within the scope of contracts such as those between DataFortress and the Customer.\n13.4 Liability due to interruption, malfunction or other events causing damage, which are based on telecommunication services of DataFortress or third parties for which DataFortress is liable, is limited to the amount of recourse possible for DataFortress against the respective telecommunication service provider.
