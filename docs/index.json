Next Video: Tech-Demo\n Did you know, that over 60% of development time is spent on DevOp tasks instead of working on the actual product [1]?\n\rWhat if there could be a way to \u0026ldquo;just run code\u0026rdquo; instead of worrying about servers and clusters?\nEasyFAAS (Easy-Function-as-a-service) lets you run your code in an easy environment, without hidden costs.\n  Get Started for free!   Why should I choose EasyFAAS over other providers? Whilst we were working with FAAS services of other providers, we usually ended up having problems with two specific things:\n (EU) Data Security Complexness  1. Our problems with (EU) Data Security Even though FAAS services of other cloud providers are technically secure, they still have the problem of being hosted by an american company. This can be a problem for EU-based companies, as the american \u0026ldquo;patriot act\u0026rdquo; states, that the US government can basically request your data from american companies to \u0026ldquo;intercept and obstruct terrorism\u0026rdquo;. There have been unconfirmed reports of misuse as well, where industry and intellectual secrets were requested.\nThis proves to be especially dangerours for companies in the finance industry, or in general where companies have an intellectual competitive advantage.\n\rOf course no one can surely say (yet) that this is really happening, and that it is not only used for the defeat of terrorism, but our company and many others agree that your data should only belong to you.\n2. Our problems with complexness Now back to a happier topic: The FAAS services of other cloud providers are amazing. They are versatile, well integrated in their system, and were a technological novelty. Our problem has just been, that if you want to \u0026ldquo;just get going\u0026rdquo;, meaning just pasting your code, you will often experience that it is not that easy.\nThe technical interconnections with other services come with a price: You will find yourself setting up API Gateways if you want the service to connect to the outside, where you will need to know about ports, firewalls, security groups and even networking.\nAlso, if you are using custom packages like Python\u0026rsquo;s numpy and pandas, you will have to create an extra layer, which proves to be quite complex, instead of just listing the packages that are used.\nOne of our main applications in the past has been to create little APIs that write and read from a database. In other FAAS solutions, this requires you to create the networking, the database connection and the custom layer to get started, which involved a lot of repetitive tasks.\nIn our EasyFAAS solution this becomes as simple as this:\nContents  Overview Serverless Function Types Managed MongoDB Getting started  EasyFAAS Main Dashboard Creating a new function Code Example: Bitcoin price getter The function Detail page   Billing  Introduction EasyFAAS reduces time to market, and let\u0026rsquo;s your programmers focus on what it important: your code!\nDid you know that you can run one function per month for free? Claim your free function\n\rTo achieve this EasyFAAS currently supports two functions:\n1. Serverless functions  Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; functions Distinguished into \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; functions  2. A managed MongoDB NoSQL database  Easy integration without much setup into your EasyFAAS functions  1. Serverless functions overview A \u0026ldquo;storage\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from a \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; function, in that it offers persistence, meaning that if a function crashes, or restarts, that objects saved in the path \u0026quot;/mnt/persistent/\u0026quot; will be saved.\nA \u0026ldquo;timed\u0026rdquo; function distinguishes itself from the \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; function, in that the timed one is running at a specific schedule, whilst the continuous is running constantly.\nThese two settings can be combined, resulting in a total of four combinable possibilities for serverless functions:\n1.1 Simple-Continuous function  Good for web applications that do not require storage. Examples:  you want an API or website displayed where data does not have to be stored you want to download current crypto prices and calculate the exchange rate between two pairs    1.2. Simple-Timed function  Good for jobs that you want to have executed, that do not require storage Examples:  triggering other endpoints with post requests starting external backups downloading data and writing it into the managed MongoDB    1.3. Storage-Continuous function  Good for web applications that require storage. Examples:  An API that receives current users as json and saves them to disk An API or website that needs to save pictures to disk    1.4. Storage-Timed function  Good for jobs that require storage Examples:  You want to download price data every hour and save it into a CSV file You want to create backups of a database    2. Managed MongoDB overview In case storage on disk is not enough, you can easily spin up a managed mongodb instance, which you can easily access from your serverless functions.\nA managed MongoDB makes sense, if you want to run multiple functions that are all accessing the same information, like if you distributed your workloads into several functions, or you are running functions in parallel.\nThe big benefits of the managed MongoDB service are, that contrary to other hosting providers it will remain in a custom network, meaning it is not exposed to the internet, but you can still easily access it in your functions.\nThis means you do not have to worry about SSL connections, strong passwords or other things, and can easily get it up and running in seconds. An example to connect with python is as follows:\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient client = MongoClient(\u0026#39;mongodb://mongodb:27017/\u0026#39;) This saves you from a lot of steps compared to other hosting providers, where you need to set up SSL certificates, ports, firewalls and user password combinations.\nExample applications for the managed MongoDB are:\n You are saving items as json into MongoDB using custom EasyFAAS functions. If one function is not enough, you can simply scale your function up, and the load will be distributed to two functions automatically. You are building an ETL pipeline, where the first function collects data and saves it into the database, the second applies calculations to it and writes it again into the database, and the third one serves the result as an API  1. Getting started EasyFAAS currently only supports Python, but we have Node, React and others already implemented. Tell us about your code preferences and we might be able to get it working.\n\r1.1 The main dashboard Head over to https://app.easyfaas.de/ and register or login.\n  The main dashboard is the central control system for EasyFAAS. In here, you will se an overview over the different services that are available.\n1.2 Create a new function Next click on New function, which takes you to the function type selection screen.\nWhat is a timed, and what is a continuous function?\n\rA timed function is best suited for jobs that do not need to run all the time, but rather run at specific intervals. If you have used Cron in the past, this is pretty much it. You can define Cron schedules as you are used to, like for example    Cron expression   Meaning    30 2 * * * Every day at 2:30   30 * * * * Every day, every hour at :30 (2:30, 3:30, 4:30 ...)   01 2 1 * * 2:01 on the first of every month   I like to use the website https://crontab.guru/ to check my expressions\n\r A continuous function runs all the time, and is best used if you want a webservice or API to run.  \r 1.3 The create function screen For this tutorial I went with a continuous function\nLet us take a look at the differnet elements\n1.3.1 Setup elements Function name\nThis can be whatever you want. The function name will later be converted to a lower-case, \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; seperated form. Like \u0026ldquo;My awesome FuNcTiOn\u0026rdquo; will become \u0026ldquo;my-awesome-function\u0026rdquo;.\nFunction count\nThis is where scalability comes into play. For now leave function count at 1, but if you later on experience that you need more power, you can easily up-scale your function here.\nPIP requirements\nNow instead of creating a layer for your FAAS function, you can just enter your pip packages here, and it will automatically install them. Easy as that.\nDebian requirements\nAll functions are build in Debian. Meaning you can easily install any Debian package if you need it. If you have installed it on your local system with \u0026ldquo;apt install \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; you can list it here. This is useful if you might need some system based tools like imagemagic, wkhtml and others. This is actually not supported yet in other FAAS services.\nVisibility\nYour EasyFAAS function comes with security enabled by default. If your function is public, it will be accessible for everyone. If it is private, you will need to send an auth token to the endpoint. Does that mean you need to create new users and everything? No, you can just get an auth token using our RestAPI using your normal user and password, and then use that token to fire towards your function. Easy as that.\nFunction type\nThere are different functions to choose from. The selection are simple function and storage function.\nThey are distinguishable in the way, that a storage function has persistence, whilst a normal function has not.\nPersistence means that if your function writes data to the disk, it will be safe.\nDo you write or read from a local file? Like a .csv, or .txt file? Then you will need persistence. If your function just calculates and does not write or read anything, you can choose a simple function\n\rPersistence is enabled at the directory /mnt/persistence/, and not in other directories.\nThis means you can still read and write temporary files in both versions, but only persist them if they are written to the /mnt/persistence path.\n\rNo persistence   with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"w\") as file: file.write(\"my temporary data\") with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"r\") as file: data = file.read() #   Persistence at /mnt/persistence/   with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"w\") as file: file.write(\"my temporary data\") with open(\"./tmp.txt\", \"r\") as file: data = file.read() #   \r 1.3.1 Code This is the core part of your function.\nYour function is using FastAPI in the background, but you do not have to worry about much if you use the already inserted starter code:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request app = FastAPI()  # basic usage @app.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def root():  return {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;}  # post requests @app.post(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def rootPost(request: Request):  data = await request.json()  print(data)  return {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;I got the post: \u0026#34; + str(data)} The EasyFAAS function only supports routing to the root domain \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;. Meaning if you create different routes they will not be used.\nWhat you can change though, is the request type. It can be GET or POST, as well as the others. For most of the use-cases GET and POST should be enough though.\nIf you want to adapt your code you can easily just add your calculations and functions inside the \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; function.\nLet us take a look at some examples\nCode example: Bitcoin Price getter  Use a newer browser to see this video.  Previous Video: EasyFAAS Intro\n Let us say you want to create a small route that just returns the current price of Bitcoin. We are using the free coingecko route for it.\nWe will adapt the code to look like this:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI import requests  base_url = \u0026#34;https://api.binance.com/api/v3\u0026#34;  app = FastAPI()  def getCoingeckoPrice(symbol):  url = base_url + f\u0026#34;/avgPrice?symbol={symbol}USDT\u0026#34;  r = requests.get(url)  return r.json()   # basic usage @app.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) async def root():  return getCoingeckoPrice(\u0026#34;BTC\u0026#34;) As we want to run this function continuously, and it does not need to save data anywhere, we will choose a continuous and simple function.\nAfter clicking on \u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo;, you will be taken back to the mainscreen, where you will see your function.\nThen, click on \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026rdquo; next to you function which will take you to the function detail screen.\nFunction Detail Page We can see a lot of information in here, but let us first just click on the link provided at \u0026ldquo;Link\u0026rdquo;. In this case, it is: https://api.easyfaas.de/functions/route/public/de96cbb3-aead-4485-9889-a76a92a8a719/function-name\nWhen I am clicking on it, it returns:\n{ \u0026#34;status_code\u0026#34;: 200, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ok\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;mins\\\u0026#34;: 5, \\\u0026#34;price\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;19756.28232097\\\u0026#34;}\u0026#34; } The \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; response of our function is located at the message key in the dictionary. Why is that? We want some kind of check if the request was really successful, or if not, some kind of error message.\nSo if your application is querying your EasyFAAS route, it should always check for the \u0026ldquo;status_code\u0026rdquo; part. If the function is failing, it will return for example code 500 together with an error message in the \u0026ldquo;status\u0026rdquo; part.\nAn example on how your application would query the EasyFAAS route is:\nimport requests  response = requests.get(\u0026#34;https://api.easyfaas.de/functions/route/public/de96cbb3-aead-4485-9889-a76a92a8a719/function-name\u0026#34;) if response.status_code != 200:  raise Exception(\u0026#34;error in EasyFAAS function: \u0026#34; + str(response.text)) else:  response = response.json()  message = json.loads(response[\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;])  print(message)  price = float(message[\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;]) Function Detail Page: Logs If you take a closer look at the function detail page you will see a \u0026ldquo;logs\u0026rdquo; section.\nIn here, everything that your function code returns will be shown. If you refresh the page it will refresh the current logs. If you function is not responsive you will see the reason why in here.\nFunction Detail Page: Metrics Metrics show you how much of the resources your function is using. If you require more \u0026ldquo;power\u0026rdquo;, maybe EasyHost or EasyScale is something for you. Otherwise just contact us.\nEasyFAAS billing You might have read the word \u0026ldquo;credits\u0026rdquo; quite often by now. What does it mean?\nEasyFAAS simplifies billing, in that it charges \u0026ldquo;credits\u0026rdquo; instead of usage-based fees. With other cloud providers, you often do not have the full transparency on what will be charged at the end of the month. There are hidden traffic fees, hidden load balancer fees and way more that you can not foresee unless you run the numbers.\nEasyFAAS solves that, in that it simplifies billing to:\n   Function Type Credit cost per Month Euro value     Simple function 1 2€   Storage function 2 4€   Managed MongoDB 5 10€    No hidden fees, no nothing. In future updates we will even include autoscaling based on the remaining credits in your account, meaning that if you have more credits than functions, and a function is close to it\u0026rsquo;s limit, it will scale up to e.g. 2 functions instead of one.\nBilling is done via Stripe, a secure and reliable payment provider.\n Get Started for free!

The two EasyHealth solutions compared Data privacy issues in the public cloud Pricing  The problems with healthcare data Healthcare data is of much value, and therefore a constant target for hacks. Just imagine the benefit for advertising or insurances, if companies would know about all the illnesses of a person. And especially how much people woud be willing to pay for a snake oil cure that promises instant relief.\nEvil employers would benefit as well, being able to \u0026ldquo;kick out\u0026rdquo; ill or pregnant people in time.\nEven though these are hopefully still science fiction scenarios, you can easily see why hackers target clinics and healthcare providers.\nLet us look at some numbers:\n2,550 data breaches have compromised over 189 million healthcare records in the last decade.\n\r89% of healthcare providers have undergone a data breach.\n\rCyber threats are expected to hit $6 trillion in losses by 2021.\n\rSource\nReasons for breaches Oftentimes the reasons for a databreach can be broken down into:\n Software that is not updated Servers that are not isolated (on-premise) Wrong usage of the public cloud Missing backups Bad networking setups  Usually clinics and healthcare providers focus their time and effort somewhere else, and end up just installing software once, never updating it. Same as your phone and computer updates, the clinic systems should be updated as well to patch new security leaks. There is a whole industry designed to discover new security leaks in applications and software, and sell them as \u0026ldquo;zero day exploits\u0026rdquo; to the highest bidder. Of course these leaks get \u0026ldquo;patched\u0026rdquo;(fixed), but if no one install the update, the well known exploit will always remain open for everyone to use.\nAdditionally, a lot of people do not implement the matching security measures when using the public cloud, leaving ports and machines open for everyone to access.\nLegal challenges when storing patient data Due to these breaches, both the US and EU have implemented strict laws regarding storage of healthcare data.\nIn the US, this protocol is called \u0026ldquo;HIPAA\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u0026rdquo; in the longform.\nIn Germany and the EU, these specifications are divided into the general part called \u0026ldquo;GDPR\u0026rdquo; (The General Data Protection Regulation) and further laws defined by each state, like the \u0026ldquo;BayKrG\u0026rdquo; (Bayrisches Krankenhausgesetz).\nEven though there are complex sections, they can be basically summarized for both as:\n1. Encrypting data  Data should always be encrypted both on the disk, as well as in transport (SSL)  2. Let users only see what is necessary  A nurse should only see medical data she needs Someone from accounting should only see \u0026ldquo;numbers\u0026rdquo; etc.  3. Log who edited and saw what  In case there is a breach or violation, you should be able to identify who accessed what  4. Be prepared to report a breach if it happened  You are required by law to submit a report if a breach occurs, in a short amount of time including details that should be prepared beforehand  5.

The fall and rise of static sites Why website speed is important EasyHost: Uniting both worlds Portfolio Pricing  What makes EasyHost different? Our secret is simple: Simplicity\nSimplicity both in terms of user experience, as well as in hosting.\nLooking for Website Programming? Head over to Websites\n\rThe fall and rise of static sites Remember the beginning of the web, with their horrible layouts, extreme colors and just pure craziness?\n Amazon back in the day\n The design and usability was horrible, and also just having to change small details of the page required re-loading the whole website, which slows down the user-experience a lot.\nThis is why new technologies like Ajax were invented, to only load tiny parts of information into the website, instead of re-loading the whole deal.\nThe web became more and more dynamic, and WordPress became the dominating CMS for both shops and blogs alike. WordPress introduced huge changes to the web, like being able to just write a blog post, without having to program a whole html website if you wanted a new page to show on your website.\nThis comes with a huge disadvantage though: The server needs to \u0026ldquo;calculate\u0026rdquo; how the final website looks like. You can imagine the WordPress working process like this:\n User opens a website WordPress queries the database to check if we have a blog post for that website If the content exists, load it from the database Grab the \u0026ldquo;Blog posts\u0026rdquo; template and insert that information in there Return the final calculated website to the user  As you can see, this is causing a lot of steps to do for the server, especially if millions of people access the website.\nWhy website speed is important  Sources: LoadStorm\n As you can see above, speed is essential nowadays. Attention is shortlived, and if people have to wait too long for a shop or website to load, they will simply leave.\nNow the big question is: Are they more likely to buy on your fancy WordPress website or on that fast, horrible 90s one?\nUniting both worlds: EasyHost The answer is simple: You can have both.\nRecent websites use Javascript and rely more and more on HTML, which differs from how websites like WordPress work. The main difference is, that new web technologies do the calculations in the browser of the user, opposed to on your server.\nIf we are going back to the example before - this is how EasyHost works:\n User opens a website The browser loads HTML, Javascript and CSS from the server, which are basically just small leightweight text documents These documents contain information how the website looks like, think of it as a blueprint The browser \u0026ldquo;builds\u0026rdquo; the website following the recipe You will see the final result in your browser  Taking it a step further with EasyHost Of course, it is not that simple. Javascript, React and NextJS still query a lot of information from APIs and servers, which adds a lot of delays again, and adds load to your servers. It is better than the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; dynamic web, but still kind of slow, especially when scaling.\nLet us say your server has to be located in Germany, with no CDN available for cost and compliance reasons.\nNow even if a user in Australia accesses the website, gets the \u0026ldquo;blueprint\u0026rdquo;, but still needs to query your API for information, loading times become quite slow. Then again, you could add your API servers all over the world, and query only the closest server for that information \u0026hellip; but isn\u0026rsquo;t there a simpler way to do it?\nCan\u0026rsquo;t we just offload the whole work to the users browser?\nThe answer is yes. With EasyHost your websites are basically \u0026ldquo;pre-rendered\u0026rdquo;, like if someone programs a page in pure HTML, offloading the whole work to the users browser. The only information that is queried from your or our server will be the \u0026ldquo;blueprint\u0026rdquo; and images.\nDoes that mean I have to program each page manually? Of course not. You can still use a CMS (content management system) like WordPress, or write text directly in Markdown like I do now, and EasyHost \u0026ldquo;converts\u0026rdquo; this to a nice website and pushes it to the server.\n Writing this text in Markdown\n   Free 15-min consultation on how EasyHost can work for you    Using the CMS\n Some examples of EasyHost in action    Website name Type Example URL     EasyCloudHost.de Company site, Blog, Shop  https://easycloudhost.de/   DataFortress.cloud Company site, Blog  https://datafortress.cloud/   BildBlatt.de WordPress Shop turned static  https://bildblatt.de/   GoodThings4U Complete Static Shop  https://goodthings4u.com/     The advantages of EasyHost / Pricing Now that we know that our websites will load super quick, and our revenues will increase, you will surely tell us that this will cost a hundred bucks a month, right?\nNo. As EasyHost is up to a 1000x lighter on the server you will save a lot of money on hosting.\n   Feature EasyHost Static EasyHost CMS EasyHost Shop Custom     Hosting ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅   Lightning Speed ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅   SSL/HTTPS (letsencrypt) ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅   Custom Domain possible ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅   Host your own HTML ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅   1 TB traffic / m ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅   CMS [1] ❌ ✅ ✅ ✅   Conversion included [2] ❌ ❌ ❌ ✅   Custom Domain included [3] ❌ ❌ ❌ ✅   Uptime guarantee 99.9% 99.5% 99% ✅   Support extra extra extra ✅   US hosted Pricing 0.99€/m 4.99€/m 19.99€/m Contact us   DE hosted Pricing 2.99€/m 9.99€/m 39.99€/m Contact us   Comparable price [4] 20$/m + traffic 40$/m + traffic 80$/m + traffic     Prices are automatically converted to your local currency on checkout\n [1] A CMS allows you to edit the content yourself in an easy web-interface (content-management-system)\n\r[2] If you do not want to convert your site yourself we can help you with that.

Your custom private cloud Managed Kubernetes service.\nAre you looking for a way to host your data and applications in a secure, private cloud, out of the hands of big corporations?\nEasyKube is your solution\n  Free Demo to see EasyKube in action!    The advantages of a custom private cloud Top 5 reasons to use a private cloud over the public cloud The simplicity of EasyKube EasyKube in AWS/Google Cloud/Azure Pricing  The advantages of a custom private cloud So, why should you care to create your own cloud, instead of using public cloud providers?\nThere are several advantages and disadvantages depending on your background. Let us say you store sensitive, intellectual data, like patents or data that gives you a competitive advantage. As you might know, the Patriot Act comes with the problem, that US cloud providers have to give your data to the US government if it is supposed to be linked to terrorism.\nBut even if that is not the case, there are laws for clinics or healthcare providers that force you to host your data in Germany, or at least the EU.\nDoes this mean I have to use a \u0026ldquo;lesser\u0026rdquo; cloud to comply and protect data? \u0026ldquo;lesser\u0026rdquo; is not the case, as Kubernetes is actually offering you a lot of technical advantages over public clouds. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out!\nTop 5 reasons to use a private cloud over the public cloud 1. No vendor lock Public clouds offer you fully integrated products, like serverless functions, that are incompatible with other clouds. Even though it\u0026rsquo;s easy, as they are ready to use in seconds, it comes as a surprise if the cloud provider increases the prices. Should you re-build your whole architecture to fit into another cloud? Or would you rather \u0026ldquo;suck it up\u0026rdquo;, and pay the increased price?\nTo avoid this situation, you should always be able to \u0026ldquo;plug and play\u0026rdquo; your applications, switching providers like your fuel station. This is possible if you are using frameworks like Kubernetes and EasyKube.\nYou are writing your applications as code, called IAAS (infrastructure as code), using barebones Kubernetes yaml files, or more complex Terraform scripts.\nIf the cloud provider increases their rates, you can just move to antother one in seconds.\n2. Your data in your hands In the last 18 months, 79% of companies have experienced at least one cloud data breach; even more alarmingly, 43% have reported 10 or more breaches in that time. Source\n\rMany companies who move to the public cloud have previously hosted their applications and data on a local machine, mostly isolated from the internet. What works in a private, secured room is not working in the public cloud though.\nThis is why many companies leave ports open that should be closed, or access their cloud via insecure channels. A password like \u0026ldquo;Tommie123\u0026rdquo; might work in a local network, where only 30 people have access, but not in the public cloud, where millions of bots constantly scan for security leaks.\nIf you are using EasyKube and Kubernetes, your data runs on your private servers, that you can even completely isolate from the internet if you want. Additionally, EasyKube comes with integrated security features like:\n SSL certificates (Letsencrypt) Automatic HTTPS forwarding (even if you try to run HTTP) Port isolation. Only port 80 and 443 (internet) are open by default  3. No unexpected costs Even though prices seem to be comparable to in-house hosting, the public cloud can cause unexpected costs. This is due to the fact, that oftentimes traffic is charged on top, or logging and monitoring cost extra. All this is automatically integrated if you are using Kubernetes and EasyKube.\nLet us take a look at an example. If you are hosting a website in a virtual instance, the usual price for a 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM machine is around 10$. This seems okay, but even having ~10.000 visitors a month pushes traffic costs to around 50$, which increases the initial cost of 10$ to 60$ total. And this does not even include backups, logging and monitoring. All this is integrated in Kubernetes and EasyKube by default.\n4. Simplicity Even though public cloud providers offer a huge variety of services, they become quite complex if everything needs to be connected with each other. Let us say you just want to deploy a simple website in a virtual machine.\nIf you are starting the machine, you need to create security groups, networking, permissions, volumes, zones and connections, which are partially unavailable because some services are only supported in some regions\u0026hellip; And then it is throwing an error because your user does not have enough permissions. What permission do I need? \u0026hellip;\nEasyKube saves you a lot of headache, because we are breaking down the complexity. With EasyKube you can actually deploy a whole application, including networking, persistence and domain based routing in less than 80 lines of code, where most is just copy-and-paste.\n5. Cost savings Whilst a public cloud cluster starts at at least 140€ a month, we are starting as low as 10$! Also our general cost is about a tenth of the public cloud Kubernetes cost.\n  Free Demo to see EasyKube in action!   The simplicity of EasyKube Let us take a look at an example to use EasyKube.

Whilst this is speeding up development, it scales really bad.\n Monolithic vs Microservice architecture. Image by Rancher\n You might be asking yourself: Why is my application or website so slow? Usually it is breaking down to 4 simple reasons.\n1. No Multiprocessing If your application is for example not supporting multiprocessing, it can only run one function at a time. Let us say you are querying a database every time a link is called. If no multiprocessing is used, only one piece of data can be retrieved from the database at a time, with the other ones being \u0026ldquo;on hold\u0026rdquo;.\n2. No Decoupling Additionally, imagine one part of your application failing. Will this block all the other parts until your applications comes back online? If no decoupling is happening the answer is yes.\nThe answer is called decoupling. Decoupling means, you are splitting your application into smaller microservices, that only do one thing, and connect them with a message queue like RabbitMQ, such that one failing part of your application is not affecting other parts.\nAnother nice benefit of this is, that server resources can be distributed to the part where they are required the most right now. Let us say you do not have much traffic on the frontend, as only some users visit your website right now, but a lot of load on backend calculations. In traditional applications each part would only have an equal part of the resources, which means the frontend is idling, whilst the backend is overloaded.\nWhen splitting up your application into Microservices, the load is automatically distributed to where it matters most. Meaning that in our example, the frontend will have fewer resources than the backend, at least for this moment where it is required.\n3. Slow Databases Then, a lot of SQL databases do not support horizontal scaling. This means, that you can only buy a bigger and bigger server, which tends to get quite expensive as only mass-produced servers (smaller ones) are cheap to use. Horizontal scaling means having a lot of \u0026ldquo;smaller\u0026rdquo; servers, that each run the same databases. There are databases that support horizontal scaling, like MongoDB and EasyDB, which can help reduce cost and speed up slow databases.\n4. No distributed computing You should never run software on just one server. If that server is either slow or completely offline, your application will fail.\nThe goal is, to distribute your application over several servers. This can be done with either using a FAAS Framework like EasyFAAS or AWS Lambda, or to use a container management framework like EasyKube or Kubernetes.\nThat way, when one server becomes slow or offline, your applications will automatically be switched to another server.\n5. No autoscaling Closely related to the previous point, there are ways to let your application scale to the demand. This is called autoscaling. Let us take the classic \u0026ldquo;Prime day\u0026rdquo; example. Once a year, Amazon is offering a huge sale, which results in over 100 times the normal server load. Then on other days, like christmas, traffic is almost nonexistent, leaving servers idle.\nThe traditional solution would be, to just buy a huge server that can handle the \u0026ldquo;Prime day\u0026rdquo;. But this causes it to be idle on 90% of the days, causing a lot of unnecessary costs. The other way would be to just \u0026ldquo;ignore\u0026rdquo; traffic peaks and loose those additional customers, which is not ideal either.\nThe answer is to let the Application scale to the current demand. This can be achieved with a FAAS Framework like EasyFAAS or AWS Lambda, or with using a container management framework like EasyKube or Kubernetes.\nHow can I scale my application?

Our Portfolio Pricing  What makes EasySEO different? Our secret is simple: Simplicity\nLooking for Website Programming? Head over to Websites\n\rA lot of companies offer SEO nowadays, but many of them remain in the old mindset that only worked years back: repeating your keywords over and over again. But actually, the current Google algorithm is not that simple anymore. It checks a lot for links that are referring to your website, and can quite accuarately, predict if a text was just written for SEO, or is actually helpful.\nWhat is the Google SEO ranking bot looking for? Even though the current algorithm is too complex to summarize, even for Google employees themselves, as it is a complex Machine Learning model, you can break the main checkpoints down to:\n1. Number of links referring to your website, and the importance of the linker  Usually good articles get cited a lot If users share you article, it proves that it must contain good content  2. The time a user remains on your website  measured via analytics or if a users hits the \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; button and returns to the source slow page loading times can be a false positive for this as well, which is why page speed is important as well. Check out EasyHost to solve this  3. Content quality  the AI model will detect if it is just keywords ideal length: 1400 words ideal structure: many subitems, using metatags and subheadings  Our portfolio We can provide you with all that.
