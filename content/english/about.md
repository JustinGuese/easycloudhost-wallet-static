  title: "Our mission is to help you scale through smart solutions"
  subtitle: "About EasyServices by EasyCloudHost.de"
  image: "images/about/about-11.jpg"
  content: "We have spent way too much time with tedious DevOp-Tasks in the past, which can easily be automated. This is how the idea of EasyServices at EasyCloudHost.de was born.
  <br><br>
  I, Justin Güse, am the founder of EasyCloudHost.de and Datafortress.cloud. After working for Porsche Holding in an innovation/data science division, where I developed many projects ranging from Big Data to Virtual Reality (see portfolio), I decided to found my own company. During my time at Porsche, I observed that many agencies or consultants do not have the main goal to satisfy their clients’ needs as the main priority, but rather how to achieve the minimal needed tasks in the shortest amount of time."

  
who_we_are:
  title: "The great story starts with a great team"
  lead: "Justin is a Freelance Data Engineer / Solution Architect working on AWS and Kubernetes projects,"
  content: " where he helped customers to make use of their data. Whilst working on these projects, he soon discovered that a lot of parts were repetitive, and programmed own little helper scripts and SAAS applications to make his life easier. Soon he discovered, that his collection of tools and services could be wrapped into a whole new offering, and help other people struggling with the same problems."
