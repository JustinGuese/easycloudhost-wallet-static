We all know that SEO (search-engine-optimization) can be a huge income generator in the Web. The two big sources of traffic remain SEO and SEA (search-engine-advertising), also called paid ads. 

What if you could skip on spending hundreds on ads, and instead **get traffic and sales for free**?

This is where SEO comes into play.

## What makes EasySEO different?

Our secret is simple: **Simplicity**

{{< /notice >}}

A lot of companies offer SEO nowadays, but many of them remain in the old mindset that only worked years back: repeating your keywords over and over again. But actually, the current Google algorithm is not that simple anymore. It checks a lot for links that are referring to your website, and can quite accuarately, predict if a text was just written for SEO, or is actually helpful.

### What is the Google SEO ranking bot looking for?

Even though the current algorithm is too complex to summarize, even for Google employees themselves, as it is a complex Machine Learning model, you can break the main checkpoints down to:

##### 1. Number of links referring to your website, and the importance of the linker

  - Usually good articles get cited a lot
  - If users share you article, it proves that it must contain good content

##### 2. The time a user remains on your website

  - measured via analytics or if a users hits the "back" button and returns to the source
  - slow page loading times can be a false positive for this as well, which is why page speed is important as well. [Check out EasyHost to solve this](/services/easyhost/)

##### 3. Content quality

  - the AI model will detect if it is just keywords 
  - ideal length: 1400 words
  - ideal structure: many subitems, using metatags and subheadings

## Our portfolio

We can provide you with all that. 
We are both running onlineshops, as well as blogs and websites where we generated content to collect a lot of SEO traffic.
Page speed is equally important, which is why you will see that our content loads super fast. [Check out EasyHost to see how this works](/services/easyhost/).
