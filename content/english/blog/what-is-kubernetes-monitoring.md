Kubernetes monitoring is the process of tracking the state of your Kubernetes deployment and identifying any issues that may arise. By monitoring your Kubernetes installation, you can ensure that your applications are running smoothly and efficiently. In this article, we'll provide an overview of Kubernetes monitoring and discuss some of the best practices for keeping your Kubernetes environment healthy.

## Why Kubernetes Monitoring Is Important

If you're running a containerized application, Kubernetes is probably orchestrating your deployment. [Kubernetes](https://easycloudhost.de/blog/what-is-kubernetes/) makes it easy to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. That's one of the reasons why Kubernetes is so popular. But with great power comes great responsibility. As your application grows, so does the need for observability in the system. This is where Kubernetes monitoring comes in.

## Kubernetes monitoring is important for a number of reasons.

- First, it helps to ensure that the Kubernetes system is running smoothly and efficiently. By monitoring Kubernetes resources, administrators can identify bottlenecks and potential problems before they cause major disruptions.
- Second, Kubernetes monitoring can help to improve performance by providing visibility into how the system is being used. This information can be used to tune the system for better efficiency.
- Finally, Kubernetes monitoring helps to ensure security by providing visibility into who is accessing the system and what they are doing. This information can be used to detect and prevent unauthorized access or activity.

In summary, Kubernetes monitoring is important for a number of reasons including ensuring smooth operation, improving performance, and ensuring security.


## What Visibility Is Required For Kubernetes Monitoring?

Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. To allow operators to monitor and troubleshoot applications, Kubernetes requires visibility into three layers of the system: the control plane, the data plane, and the application layer.

1. **The control plane** consists of the components that manage the state of the Kubernetes cluster, such as the API server, scheduler, and controller manager. To be able to monitor and troubleshoot the control plane, operators need visibility into the API server logs and metrics.

1. **The data plane** consists of the components that manipulate the data within the Kubernetes cluster, such as the kubelet and kube-proxy. To be able to monitor and troubleshoot the data plane, operators need visibility into the kubelet logs and metrics.

1. **The application layer** consists of the applications running within the Kubernetes cluster. To be able to monitor and troubleshoot applications, operators need visibility into application logs and metrics.

In order to provide adequate visibility for monitoring and troubleshooting, operators must have access to all three layers of visibility. This can be accomplished by deploying a logging solution that collects data from all three layers and makes it available to operators in a central location.

In addition, operators should deploy a monitoring solution that provides visibility into all three layers in order to identify issues early and prevent them from becoming critical problems. By providing adequate visibility into all three layers of Kubernetes, operators can confidently monitor and manage their applications at scale.

## How To Do Kubernetes Monitoring

With the ever-growing popularity of containerized applications, Kubernetes has emerged as the leading container orchestration platform. But while Kubernetes can greatly simplify the deployment and management of containerized apps, it also introduces a new set of challenges when it comes to monitoring and logging. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the best practices for Kubernetes monitoring.

One of the most important aspects of Kubernetes monitoring is tracking resource utilization. By understanding how your containers are using resources such as CPU and memory, you can ensure that your applications are running efficiently and avoid potential performance issues. The Kubernetes platform provides a number of tools for tracking resource utilization, including the kubelet stats API and the cadvisor metrics exporter. You can also use third-party tools such as Prometheus to collect and visualize resource usage data.

Another key aspect of Kubernetes monitoring is logging. Containerized applications often generate large volumes of log data, which can be difficult to manage and analyze. The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is a popular choice for collecting and visualizing log data, but there are a number of other options available as well. Once you have your logging solution in place, you'll need to configure your containers to send their log output to the appropriate location. For example, you can use the fluentd DaemonSet to deploy a logging agent on every node in your Kubernetes cluster.

Monitoring and logging are essential for any production-grade Kubernetes deployment. By following the tips in this article, you can make sure that your application is running smoothly and avoid potential problems down the road.
