Kubernetes Secrets are a way of protecting data that is needed by applications running in a Kubernetes cluster, but which should not be exposed to the outside world. They are similar to Docker secrets and can be used to store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and SSL certificates. In this post, we will take a look at how Secrets work in [Kubernetes](https://easycloudhost.de/blog/what-is-kubernetes/), and we will see how they can be used to protect our data. We will also see how they can be created and managed using the Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI). Finally, we will take a look at some practical examples of how Secrets can be used in a Kubernetes environment.

## Why Are Secrets Important?

In the world of cloud computing, secret management is essential. Secrets are essentially pieces of information that should be kept hidden from unauthorized individuals. This can include everything from passwords and API keys to confidential files and sensitive data. In a Kubernetes cluster, secrets are used to store and manage sensitive information in a safe and secure manner.

There are a number of benefits to using secrets in Kubernetes, including improved security, enhanced compliance, and simplified management. Secrets can be easily created, updated, and deleted using the Kubernetes API-server.

In addition, secrets can be encrypted at rest using various encryption providers such as Vault by HashiCorp. By using Kubernetes secrets, businesses can protect their critical data and avoid the negative consequences of a data breach.

## How Does Kubernetes Leverage Secrets?

Secrets are stored as Base64-encoded data, and they can be used by pods to connect to external services or to perform other sensitive tasks. Secrets can be defined in a YAML file or created using the `kubectl` command-line tool. To use a secret, a pod must have permission to access the secret object. This can be accomplished by granting the appropriate RBAC roles to the service account that is used by the pod. Once a pod has been granted access to a secret, it can reference the secret data using environment variables.

Kubernetes also provides a way to inject secrets into containers using volumes. This approach is useful for cases where the application does not support referencing secrets via environment variables. When using volumes, the secret data is stored in a tmpfs volume, which is automatically mounted into the container when it is started. The tmpfs volume is only accessible by the container itself, providing an additional layer of security.

Secrets can also be used to create TLS certificates that can be used to secure communications between pods. To generate a certificate, a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) must first be created. This CSR can then be submitted to a certificate authority (CA) to generate a signed certificate. The signed certificate and associated private key can then be stored as secrets in Kubernetes. These TLS secrets can be used by pods to establishing secure connections with each other.

In summary, secrets are an important part of managing sensitive information in Kubernetes. They can be used to store data such as passwords and API keys, as well as TLS certificates for securing communications between pods. Secrets are securely stored and can only be accessed by pods that have been granted permission to do so. This allows for fine-grained control over which pods have access to sensitive data.

## Editing A Secret

You can edit a secret in Kubernetes by updating the YAML definition file for the secret and then applying the changes. To edit a secret, you first need to retrieve the current definition file for the secret. You can do this using the `kubectl get` command. For example, to retrieve the definition file for a secret named "my-secret", you would use the following command: 

`kubectl get secret my-secret -o yaml`. 

This will output the YAML definition file for the secret to stdout.

Once you have retrieved the current definition file for the secret, you can edit it using your preferred text editor. There are a few things to keep in mind when editing a Kubernetes secret definition file. First, each entry in the "data" map must be base64-encoded. Second, you must not change the size of any of the entries in the "data" map. If you need to add or remove an entry, you can do so by adding or removing a line from the "data" map. Finally, make sure to save your changes to the definition file before exiting your text editor.

Once you have made your changes to the definition file, you can apply them by using the `kubectl apply` command. For example, to apply my changes to the "my-secret" secret, I would use the following command: 

`kubectl apply -f my-secret.yaml`. 

This will update the secret in Kubernetes with your new changes.

## Built-in Secret Types

There are three types of secrets available in Kubernetes: generic, Opaque, and service account. Generic secrets can be used for storing any type of data, such as passwords, API keys, and certificates.

1. **Opaque secrets** are used for storing **binary data**, such as images. Service account secrets are used for authenticating Kubernetes APIs. Each type of secret has benefits and drawbacks that you should consider when deciding which type of secret to using.

2. **Generic secrets** are the most **flexible type** of secret, as they can be used for any type of data. However, they are also the least secure type of secret, as they are not encrypted by default. Opaque secrets are more secure than generic secrets, as they are encrypted by default. However, they cannot be used for storing non-binary data.

3. **Service account secrets** are the **most secure** type of secret, as they are both encrypted and signed by default. However, they can only be used for authenticating Kubernetes APIs.

When choosing a secret type, you should consider the security requirements of your application and the type of data you need to store. If security is your primary concern, then you should use a service account secret. If you need to store binary data, then you should use an opaque secret. If you need to store any other type of data, then you can use a generic secret.

## Conclusion:

Kubernetes Secrets provide a way to store and access sensitive information in a secure manner. They are important because they can help you keep your data safe, while still allowing you to use it when needed. Kubernetes leverages Secrets by using them to store passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information. Editing a Secret is easy, and there are several built-in Secret types that make it easy to securely store your data.
