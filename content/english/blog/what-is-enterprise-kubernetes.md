In today's business world, more and more companies are turning to the cloud to run their operations. Cloud-based applications and services offer a number of benefits, including scalability, flexibility, and cost savings. But not all clouds are created equal. In order to get the most out of the cloud, you need a platform that can provide the stability and performance your business needs. That's where enterprise Kubernetes comes in. Keep reading to learn more about what enterprise Kubernetes is and how it can benefit your business.

## Kubernetes Is Incomplete By Design

As any DevOps engineer knows, Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized workloads. However, Kubernetes is also notoriously complex, and many users find it difficult to get started. This is by design - according to the principle of "minimum viable product", Kubernetes is intentionally limited in scope in order to simplify the user experience. This approach has its benefits, but it also means that Kubernetes is not suitable for all use cases. In particular, users who need more advanced features or customization will be better off with a different tool. Nevertheless, for those who are willing to put in the effort, Kubernetes can be an extremely powerful way to manage containerized workloads.

## Kubernetes Promotes Choice

With Kubernetes, there are a lot of choices to be had in terms of what software to run, how to deploy it, and where to host it. This is a deliberate design decision - Kubernetes is meant to be a platform that can run anywhere, from on-premises datacenters to public clouds. As such, it needs to be flexible enough to accommodate different workloads and configurations.

This flexibility can be seen in the wide range of Kubernetes components that are available. For example, there are multiple container runtimes to choose from, including Docker, rkt, and CRI-O. There are also multiple storage solutions, networking plugins, and monitoring tools. This wealth of choice can be both a blessing and a curse - on one hand, it allows users to tailor their Kubernetes setup to their specific needs; on the other hand, it can be overwhelming for those who are just getting started with Kubernetes.

In any case, this flexibility is one of the key features of Kubernetes that sets it apart from other orchestration platforms.

## Choice Entails Risk

Any time you have to make a choice, you're also taking a risk. The same is true when choosing which container orchestration platform to use for your business. While Kubernetes has become the industry standard, it's important to remember that it's still a relatively new technology. That means that there are bound to be some quirks and bugs that need to be ironed out.

In addition, Kubernetes is a complex system, and it can be difficult to find qualified personnel who are able to effectively manage it. However, the benefits of Kubernetes often outweigh the risks. It's a powerful platform that provides a lot of flexibility and scalability. In addition, the Kubernetes community is very active and always working on improving the platform. As a result, choosing Kubernetes is often a wise choice for businesses that need a robust container orchestration solution.

## Kubernetes Components

This section discusses the various enterprise Kubernetes components that are available to help you deploy and manage your containerized applications at scale.

Kubernetes Components - The various Kubernetes components that you would need to manage yourself include:

1. **kube-apiserver**: The kube-apiserver is the central component of the Kubernetes control plane and is responsible for exposing the Kubernetes API. It also acts as a proxy for all other Kubernetes API calls.

2. **kube-controller-manager**: The kube-controller-manager is responsible for managing the different types of controllers in Kubernetes such as replica sets, deployments, and service accounts.

3. **kube-scheduler**: The kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods onto nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

4. **etcd**: etcd is a key-value store used by Kubernetes to store materialized configuration data.

5. **kubelet**: The kubelet is the primary agent responsible for running pods on nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

6. **kube-proxy**: The kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the Kubernetes cluster and is responsible for forwarding traffic to the appropriate pod based on IP address and port number.

7. **Container Network Interface (CNI)**: CNI is a library that defines APIs for writing network plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers. There are many CNI plugins available that can be used with Kubernetes such as Calico, Flannel, and Weave Net.

8. **Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)**: The CCM is a cloud vendor-specific controller that runs in addition to the core controller components listed above. It provides integration with specific cloud provider APIs such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.

9. **Helm**: Helm is a package manager for installing and managing software packages in Kubernetes. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade your software packages using preconfigured templates called charts.

10. **operator-sdk**: The operator-sdk is a toolkit used for developing operators which are programs that extend Kubernetes to manage custom resources.

## Enterprise Kubernetes And Software Development

As software development teams have started to adopt containerization and orchestration using Kubernetes, they have realized significant benefits in speed and efficiency. However, many organizations are still struggling to get their Enterprise Kubernetes platforms up and running smoothly. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the challenges involved in setting up an Enterprise Kubernetes platform, and how to overcome them.

One of the biggest challenges facing organizations is the lack of skilled resources. While there are many open-source resources available, it can be difficult to find personnel with the necessary skills to properly configure and manage a Kubernetes platform. Another challenge is the lack of integration between existing tools and processes. Many organizations' software development pipelines are not designed to work with Kubernetes, which can lead to increased complexity and reduced efficiency.

Fortunately, there are a number of ways to address these challenges. One option is to use a managed service such as Google Container Engine or Amazon EKS. These services provide pre-configured Kubernetes environments that can be easily integrated into existing development processes. Another option is to use a cloud-based IDE such as Cloud9, which gives developers access to a ready-to-use Kubernetes environment. Finally, there are a number of training resources available online that can help organizations get the most out of their Enterprise Kubernetes platforms.

By taking advantage of these options, organizations can overcome the challenges associated with setting up an Enterprise Kubernetes platform and reap the benefits of faster and more efficient software development.

## What Is Enterprise Kubernetes Then?

Enterprise Kubernetes is an increasingly popular solution for large businesses that want to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. While there are many options for deploying Kubernetes, enterprise Kubernetes platforms offer a number of unique benefits, including the ability to run multiple clusters in a single environment, support for multiple cloud providers, and advanced security features.

Unlike some other Kubernetes distributions, enterprise Kubernetes platforms are designed to be easily deployed on-premises or in the cloud. As a result, they offer businesses a high degree of flexibility when it comes to deploying and managing containerized applications. In addition, enterprise Kubernetes platforms provide a number of tools and services that make it easy to monitor and manage clusters, making them an ideal solution for businesses that want to adopt Kubernetes at scale.
