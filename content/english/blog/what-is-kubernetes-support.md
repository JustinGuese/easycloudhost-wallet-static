Kubernetes is a fast-growing container orchestration platform that has gained a lot of traction in the last few years. Many companies are starting to use Kubernetes as their primary way of deploying applications and services. As Kubernetes usage increases, so does the demand for Kubernetes support. In this blog post, we will discuss what Kubernetes support is and why your company may need it. We will also provide some tips on how to find the right Kubernetes support provider for your business.

## Why Do I need Kubernetes Support?

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized workloads and services, but it can be complex to set up and maintain. A Kubernetes support team can help you get the most out of your investment by providing expertise and guidance on best practices. Here are some of the ways a Kubernetes support team can be useful:

## Design and set up an efficient Kubernetes cluster that meets your specific needs

Kubernetes support is essential for anyone who wants to set up and maintain a Kubernetes cluster. Without support, it can be difficult to keep your cluster running smoothly and efficiently. A good support team will help you design and set up your cluster in a way that meets your specific needs. They can also provide ongoing support and maintenance so that you can focus on using Kubernetes to improve your business. In short, Kubernetes support is an essential part of using Kubernetes effectively. without it, you may find yourself struggling to get the most out of this powerful system.

## Train your team members on how to use Kubernetes

Kubernetes support training helps teams work more Kubernetically. This is a simple yet effective way to ensure that team members are able to use Kubernetes to its fullest potential. Kubernetes support training covers topics such as:

1. Kubernetes Basics
2. How to install and configure Kubernetes
3. How to create and manage Kubernetes resources
4. How to deploy applications on Kubernetes
5. Kubernetes security best practices.

Kubernetes support training is an important part of any team's arsenal, and it is recommended for all teams who want to make the most out of Kubernetes.

## Stay up to date on the latest Kubernetes releases and features

As anyone who has ever tried to keep up with the latest software releases knows, it can be a full-time job just to stay current. New features and updates are released at an ever-increasing pace, and it can be difficult to keep up. This is particularly true for those who are responsible for managing Kubernetes clusters. Not only is it important to stay up to date on the latest Kubernetes releases, but it is also important to have a good understanding of the new features and how they can be used. This is where Kubernetes support comes in.

By subscribing to a Kubernetes support plan, you can rest assured that you will always have access to the latest releases and features. In addition, you will have someone to help you if you run into any problems or have any questions. With Kubernetes support, you can focus on using Kubernetes instead of worrying about staying up to date.

## Monitor your Kubernetes cluster for performance and stability issues

If you're running a Kubernetes cluster, you need a way to monitor its performance and stability. That's where Kubernetes support comes in. By using a tool like Datadog, you can get comprehensive visibility into your Kubernetes environment. With Datadog, you can collect and track metrics from all of your containers, pods, and nodes. You can also set up alerts to notify you of any potential issues. 

In addition, Datadog provides built-in dashboards for popular Kubernetes metrics, making it easy to spot trends and identify problems. By using Datadog or another Kubernetes monitoring tool, you can ensure that your cluster is running smoothly and efficiently.

Alternatives to Datadog are a self-built ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kubernetes), or a Prometheus plus Grafana distribution.

## Help you troubleshoot problems when they arise

No matter how well you engineer your system, problems will always arise. That's why having Kubernetes support is so important. When something goes wrong, you need to be able to quickly identify and fix the problem. Otherwise, it can escalate and cause even more damage. With Kubernetes support, you have someone to help you troubleshoot the problem and get your system back up and running.

In addition, if you're ever faced with a major outage, you'll have someone on hand to help you recover. Without Kubernetes' support, you might be left scrambling to figure out what went wrong and that can be a costly mistake. So if you're serious about keeping your system running smoothly, make sure you have Kubernetes support. It could be the difference between a minor hiccup and a major disaster.

## Provide guidance on using third-party tools and services with Kubernetes

There are so many different components that need to be configured and kept track of, and any change can have unexpected consequences. Kubernetes is a tool that can help manage this complexity by providing a way to automate the deployment and management of containerized applications. While Kubernetes itself is fairly easy to use, it can be difficult to find good documentation on how to use it with third-party tools and services.

This is where Kubernetes support comes in. By providing guidance on the best practices for using Kubernetes, support teams can help organizations get the most out of this powerful tool. As a result, Kubernetes support can be incredibly valuable for any organization that is looking to adopt this technology.

A Kubernetes support team can be a valuable resource for organizations of all sizes that are looking to get the most out of their investment in Kubernetes. By working with a support team, you can ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is set up correctly, runs smoothly, and is always up to date with the latest features.

## What are possible Kubernetes' Support Tiers?

Kubernetes support tiers are a set of support levels designed to help users get the most out of their Kubernetes experience. 
If you are building up an internal team we recommend seperating support levels into three tiers:
**Standard, Premium, and Enterprise**. Each tier offers different levels of support, features, and benefits.

- The **Standard tier** is the most basic level of support. It includes access to community forums and online documentation. If you need help with Kubernetes, this is the best place to start.

- The **Premium tier** adds 24/7 support from Kubernetes experts. You'll also get access to exclusive video tutorials, training materials, and support tools. This tier is ideal for businesses that rely on Kubernetes for mission-critical applications.

- The **Enterprise tier** is the highest level of support available. It includes all the features and benefits of the other two tiers, plus additional features designed for large businesses and enterprises. These include on-site support, account management, and priority access to new features and updates.


## Who Supports Kubernetes? Can't I Just Use The Kubernetes Community For Support?

Any qualified enterprise should have some additional support for Kubernetes. It is an open-source system with many parts, including some optional ones. A company that wants to use Kubernetes needs to get it from a reliable provider who can also offer support. Red Hat and Canonical are examples of companies that offer enterprise-grade Kubernetes distributions that come with support. For example, with Red Hat OpenShift, customers get not only the software but also a subscription for access to the knowledge base and support from engineers. Likewise, with Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes, customers have access to phone and email support 24x7x365.

Sometimes organizations want to use a community distribution of Kubernetes but with enterprise-level support on top. In this case, we would recommend taking a look at Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS). EKS is designed for businesses or enterprises that want to run containers at scale but may not have the in-house expertise to operate their own Kubernetes clusters. With EKS, they can launch and manage production-ready Kubernetes clusters while AWS handles critical tasks like security patching, updates, and backup operations.

Enterprise organisations need stability and predictability when it comes to container orchestration infrastructure so they can focus on developing and deploying applications rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. This is where having a supported version of Kubernetes comes in handy as it gives businesses the confidence that someone else is keeping an eye on things and has their back should anything go wrong.

## Is Kubernetes dropping Docker support?

There has been some recent confusion about whether or not Kubernetes is dropping support for Docker. The short answer is that Kubernetes is not dropping support for Docker, and you can continue to use Docker with Kubernetes. However, there are some changes being made to the way that Kubernetes works with Docker, and you should be aware of these changes if you're using Kubernetes in your development workflow.

One of the biggest changes is that Kubernetes is now using its own container runtime, called containerd. This change was made in order to improve support for multiple container runtimes, and to allow Kubernetes to better integrate with other tools and platforms. As a result of this change, you may see some differences in how your containers behave when running on Kubernetes. However, this change should not impact your ability to use Docker with Kubernetes.

Another change that's being made is that the default storage driver for containers is being switched from devicemapper to overlay2. This change is being made in order to improve performance and reliability. Again, this change should not impact your ability to use Docker with Kubernetes.

So, in short, Kubernetes is not dropping support for Docker. However, there are some changes being made to how Kubernetes works with Docker, so you should be aware of these changes if you're using Kubernetes in your development workflow.
