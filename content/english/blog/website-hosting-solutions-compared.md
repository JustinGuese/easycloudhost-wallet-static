When it comes to creating an online shop or website, there are a few options available to you. The most popular systems are WordPress, Shopify, Magenta, or Shopware. In this blog post, we will compare Shopify and WordPress, as the main SAAS and Open-Source systems, with our in-house solution [EasyHost](/services/websites). This will help you decide which is the best option for you.

WordPress is a popular system that is used by millions of people around the world. It is a free system that is relatively easy to use. However, it does require some technical knowledge to set up your shop. 

Shopify is a paid system that is also relatively easy to use. It offers more "plug and play"-features than WordPress, but it can be a little more expensive. [EasyHost](/services/websites) is our hosting solution, that uses static websites to reduce hosting cost, increase speed and make it nearly unhackable. This website is an [EasyHost](/services/websites) website!

## SAAS vs Self-hosted CMS or Shop systems

SAAS describes the software, that is hosted by someone else, meaning you do not have to worry about much technical stuff. This is good if you just "want to get started", but it also comes with a vendor lock-in. vendor-lock-in means, that it is harder to change your hosting provider, or integrate custom apps or plugins. Shopify is a SAAS system, and runs only on their servers, meaning you can not have a look at the source code, add things easily and change hosting providers. This means they can dictate the price of their service, and if a plugin or app becomes more expensive or unavailable in the future, you are left stranded.

Self-hosted, or open-source CMSs, are pieces of software that you need to install yourself. Even though this comes with a big hosting/tech effort, you will have almost complete control over what to run, including a full vision of the code itself.

## The Pros and Cons of SAAS vs Self-hosted websites

The good thing about SAAS, as stated above, is that you usually do not need to worry about many things. This comes with a price though. Shopify is starting at $29/month, but this is usually not even the final price. Every plugin and app costs extra, and if you want to include SEO tools, better order management, or nicer themes you will easily reach the $100-150/month range.

This can be quite much, especially if you are just starting with your business. If you are a startup with huge funds go for it, but in our opinion, the value-to-price ratio is not matching. 

Also, the app and plugin range of Shopify is smaller than WordPress, and it is easier to "adapt" a plugin to fit your needs.

It is for example harder to integrate "custom" shop or website functionalities into Shopify compared to WordPress, like booking or price comparison pages. 

An argument for self-hosted/WordPress is, therefore, that you will have complete control over everything. WordPress allows you to get started at around $5/month, and many plugins are free.

But what are the downsides of WordPress?

WordPress tends to get slow if you are installing a lot of plugins, or if you have a lot of customers. WordPress is a dynamic website, meaning that each time you are visiting a WordPress website, the content needs to be calculated on the server, which slows it down a lot if a lot of people are visiting. 

Also, WordPress is one of the main targets of hackers, as it is written in PHP, which is known for its many vulnerabilities. Additionally, it tends to break a lot, causing you downtime and the loss of a lot of visitors or customers. Even Google is factoring website speed into their results a lot. 

## Introducing the "static"-technology

[EasyHost](/services/websites) is based on the "static" technology, which means that compared to WordPress, it renders the website on the device of the user, and pre-calculates a lot of things beforehand. 

Imagine it like instructions to draw a picture. Whilst WordPress is starting to draw one picture for each visitor, depending on their device and settings, [EasyHost](/services/websites) pre-draws a lot of pictures and then just decides which to send to which visitor. 

This saves a lot of resources, as the server does not nearly need to be as big as with self-hosted solutions.

But will I have the same nice UI as in WordPress or Shopify? Yes, as we are using the "forestry.io" CMS as an editing system. It is as easy as any CMS you have been using so far, and we are handling all the tech stuff in the background.

## So which one is right for me - WordPress, Shopify, or EasyHost?

This depends on your situation. [EasyHost](/services/websites) is situated in the middle between WordPress and Shopify, but for a cheaper price.

If you are a startup with a lot of funds, and you do not need many plugins, feel free to go with Shopify, as it lets you customize a lot of things and connections easily, without having a look at the code.

If you need a lot of customization, and you want full control, or hosting on your servers, you might want to go with WordPress. 

If you want something in between have a look at [EasyHost](/services/websites), or contact us for a [free 15-minute consultation](/contact). [EasyHost](/services/websites) works for both websites and shops and offers a nice and easy-to-use CMS for non-tech users. If you decide to go with an [EasyHost](/services/websites) website, we will need to create or copy a website depending on your template choices one time, and after that, you will benefit from cheaper hosting than WordPress and Shopify. The best part: our one-time package starts from just $255, and continues with $10/month for hosting.

As the [EasyHost](/services/websites) website will be static, no hackers can hack it, and unless some breaking update is pushed, the website will not crash or experience downtimes, as it will be made available on at least three different servers located in Germany, Finland, and the US!

This will give you a nice international speed boost as well, leaving you with an almost 100 Google Pagespeed score.
