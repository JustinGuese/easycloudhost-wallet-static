Kubernetes Ingress is a term you may have heard floating around in container orchestration. But what exactly is it? Kubernetes Ingress can be best described as a way to control access to your Kubernetes services from outside your network. It provides a way to expose your services to the internet and also allows for load balancing and SSL termination. This blog post will give a brief overview of what Kubernetes Ingress is, and how you can use it in your environment!

When developers want to expose an application to traffic (e.g., for testing), they typically define one of these basic services as a starting point: NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ClusterIP. However, if they are using Kubernetes, there is another option: Ingress.

Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that provides routing for external traffic to reach Services within a cluster. By specifying Ingress rules, a user can route all traffic from a single domain (e.g, example.com) to different Services based on the path (e.g., /API/users goes to User Service, / goes to frontend Service). This is especially useful when combined with TLS termination and name-based virtual hosting; a single Kubernetes cluster can then route traffic for multiple domains to different backend services. Because Ingress sits at the edge of the cluster, it can also provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting without requiring any changes to the Services themselves.

Kubernetes Ingress is therefore a very powerful tool for routing external traffic to Services within a Kubernetes cluster. If you are using Kubernetes, you should consider using Ingress to expose your applications to external traffic.

It works with custom domains too, including automatic certificate generation - so if you want to create subroutes for a domain it basically comes down to just some lines of code. The magic of Kubernetes.

## Enterprise Kubernetes ingress

Enterprise Kubernetes ingress refers to the process of managing traffic going into and out of a Kubernetes cluster. This can be done using either a public or private Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider. To use ingress, you will need to create an Ingress resource in your Kubernetes manifest file. This resource will define the rules for how traffic should be routed.

For example, you can specify that all traffic going to a specific path should be redirected to a specific service. To make sure that your ingress rules are followed, you will need to deploy an Ingress controller. There are many different types of Ingress controllers available, so you will need to choose the one that best suits your needs.

Once you have deployed your Ingress controller, you will need to configure it. This includes specifying the address of your Kubernetes cluster and the path to your Ingress resource file. After your Ingress controller is configured, you can then start routing traffic through it.

Enterprise Kubernetes ingress provides a way to manage traffic going into and out of a Kubernetes cluster safely and efficiently. By using an Ingress resource and controller, you can specify exactly how traffic should be routed, ensuring that your services can handle the load.

## Is an ingress a load balancer?

Ingress is a load balancer provided as a part of the Kubernetes container orchestration platform. It enables organizations to route traffic to services within Kubernetes clusters in a manner that is both efficient and scalable. When used in conjunction with other Kubernetes components, Ingress can provide advanced features such as SSL termination, URL rewrites, and content-based routing.

While Ingress is often used to load balance web traffic, it is not limited to this use case and can be used to load balance any type of traffic. As such, an Ingress is a valuable tool for those looking to improve the performance of their Kubernetes clusters.

## An Ingress can be hard to integrate

Ingress is a popular word in the Kubernetes community, but it can be hard to understand what it actually is and how it works. In simple terms, Ingress is a way to route external traffic to your Kubernetes services. It acts as a load balancer, distributing traffic across all the pods in a service. This can be useful when you want to expose a single service to the world, or when you want to load balance traffic across multiple services.

Ingress can be particularly hard to integrate because it requires setting up an Ingress controller, which is itself a Kubernetes service. Once the Ingress controller is up and running, you'll need to configure it with the desired routing rules. This can be a complex process, but there are many tools and tutorials available to help you get started. With a little effort, you can get Ingress up and running in your Kubernetes cluster in no time.

## An Ingress delivers big benefits

While there are numerous benefits that Ingress delivers, some of the key advantages include:

- By abstracting away the details of the underlying infrastructure, Ingress makes it possible to easily move applications between different environments, whether it's on-premise or in the cloud.
- Ingress also provides a single point of contact for users, making it simpler to manage traffic flows and reducing the complexity of deployments.
- In addition, Ingress offers a number of features that can help to optimize performance and ensure availability, such as load balancing and session persistence.

Overall, Ingress delivers big benefits in terms of flexibility, manageability, and performance. As a result, it has become a popular choice for deploying applications at scale.
